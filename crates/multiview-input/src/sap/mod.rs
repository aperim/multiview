//! **SAP** — the essence-agnostic Session Announcement Protocol
//! (IETF **RFC 2974**, Experimental) engine: announce Multiview's own multicast
//! outputs and discover those announced by VLC / Dante-AES67 / RAVENNA gear.
//!
//! > **SAP = Session Announcement Protocol, *not* subtitles.** It periodically
//! > multicasts an **SDP** descriptor of a media session to a well-known group
//! > on UDP **9875**; receivers build a browsable list (VLC's "Network Streams
//! > (SAP)"). SAP carries **only** the SDP — the media itself rides RTP or raw
//! > UDP MPEG-TS on the address in the SDP `c=`/`m=` lines.
//!
//! This module is the RFC 2974 layer of [ADR-0041]: it is **SDP-content
//! agnostic** (it never parses the SDP body — that is the `sdp/` model's job).
//! It provides
//!
//! * [`packet`] — the pure byte-slice ⇄ typed [`SapPacket`] codec (parse +
//!   encode), with the adversarially-corrected wire details honoured (3-bit
//!   version, `auth_len` counted in 32-bit **words**, `E=1`/hash-0/compression
//!   rejected).
//! * [`groups`] — the multicast group set a listener joins and the scope
//!   selector that picks the announce group from the media address.
//! * [`session`] — a bounded, fixed-capacity, drop-oldest table of discovered
//!   (untrusted) sessions with implicit purge and anti-hijack deletion handling.
//! * [`announce`] — the pure announce schedule (±1/3 jitter, ≥30 s floor) and
//!   the announcement / deletion packet builders.
//! * [`transport`] *(feature `st2110`)* — the supervised tokio `UdpSocket`
//!   listener + independent-timer announcer + bounded drop-oldest receive ring.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariants #1 / #10)
//!
//! SAP lives strictly on the control/discovery plane: the listener, the
//! announce timer, and the session table are **off the output-clock data
//! plane** and are physically incapable of back-pressuring the engine. The
//! receive ring is bounded drop-oldest; the engine never awaits any of this.
//!
//! ## Security (ADR-0041 §8, brief §9)
//!
//! SAP is unauthenticated and trivially spoofable. Discovered sessions are
//! **untrusted candidates** requiring explicit operator confirm-to-bind — never
//! auto-ingested. The table is hard-capped + rate-limited, encrypted (`E=1`)
//! and compressed (`C=1`) packets are rejected, and inbound deletions (`T=1`)
//! against a tracked entry are ignored (a hijack vector).
//!
