//! The SAP **announce schedule** and **packet builders** (RFC 2974 §3/§5/§6;
//! ADR-0041 §5, brief §3) — pure logic, no sockets.
//!
//! An announcer re-sends each session's SDP on a **≥ 30 s** base cadence (the
//! Dante/AES67 interop default; the RFC bandwidth-fair timer is a future option)
//! with **±1/3 jitter** so many announcers on a group de-synchronise rather than
//! pulse together. [`AnnounceSchedule::next_delay`] takes an externally-supplied
//! random `sample` (the transport's RNG) and returns a delay in
//! `[2/3·base, 4/3·base)`; keeping the RNG out of this module leaves the schedule
//! deterministic and testable.
//!
//! [`announcement`] and [`deletion`] build the `T=0` / `T=1` [`SapPacket`]s from a
//! session's stable non-zero [`stable_hash`], origin, and SDP — carrying the
//! explicit `application/sdp` payload-type. The announcer emits a deletion as a
//! courtesy on teardown; inbound deletions are ignored elsewhere (ADR-0041 §8).
//!
//! This is off the output clock and cannot pace it (inv #1): the announce timer
//! is independent of the per-tick output loop.
