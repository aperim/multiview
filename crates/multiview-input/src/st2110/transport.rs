//! ST 2110 UDP receive transport — **feature `st2110`**.
//!
//! This module owns the *testable core* of an ST 2110 receive source: the
//! application-layer [`PacketSource`] seam that delivers post-receive RTP packet
//! units, the ST 2022-7 sequence-keyed dedup over that seam
//! ([`DualPathPacketSource`]), and the
//! [`St2110Producer`]: a [`FrameProducer`](crate::source::FrameProducer) that
//! drives the IN-1 [`FrameAssembler`](crate::st2110::assembler::FrameAssembler)
//! and rebases the RTP 90 kHz timestamps onto the nanosecond timeline (via the
//! [`PtsNormalizer`](crate::normalize) the [`IngestPump`] holds).
//!
//! ## The seam vs. the NIC
//!
//! The pure depacketizers in the parent module ([`super::rtp`] / [`super::v20`]
//! …) turn bytes into typed values; the [`St2110Producer`] turns a stream of
//! those into produced frames. Both are driven by **injected** packet units and
//! are fully unit-tested with no NIC. The actual UDP sockets — [`RtpReceiver`]
//! and the two-path [`DualPathReceiver`] — bind a `tokio` `UdpSocket`, join a
//! multicast group, and need a real ST 2110 network (a PTP-disciplined NIC, an
//! IGMP-joined multicast source); this devcontainer has none, so that socket
//! path is exercised only by the gated/`#[ignore]`d live test.
//! [`channel_bridge`](RtpReceiver::channel_bridge) connects the async socket to
//! the sync seam through a **bounded, drop-oldest** channel so a stalled reader
//! never back-pressures the receive task (invariant #10).
//!
//! ## PTP / ST 2059 (informs, never paces)
//!
//! Per [streaming-gotchas §5] the master clock stays `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`; the
//! output is **never** slaved to an input. The RTP 90 kHz media clock is used
//! for per-input PTS only, and the first frame anchors to the master clock's
//! "now" exactly like every other source (the [`IngestPump`] does this). A PTP
//! epoch may later *inform* the rebase anchor, but full ST 2059 lock is out of
//! scope here (the brief's "free-run the rest" guidance).
//!
//! ## No native FFI (pure / LGPL-clean default)
//!
//! It deliberately does **no** native FFI (uses `tokio`'s safe `UdpSocket`),
//! keeping `multiview-input` `unsafe_code = forbid`, and it never paces the output
//! clock: received datagrams are depacketized and handed to the ingest pipeline
//! (which writes the last-good-frame store), exactly like every other source
//! (invariants #1 / #10).
//!
