//! `YouTube` live ingest via an external, runtime-discovered **`yt-dlp`** resolver
//! (ADR-0015), behind the off-by-default `youtube` feature.
//!
//! `YouTube` publishes no stable manifest URL: the playable HLS master lives behind
//! the private `InnerTube` `player` API and a frequently-rotated JavaScript
//! `n`-signature. Rather than own that fast-moving scraping surface on a
//! bulletproof-output engine, Multiview delegates extraction to `yt-dlp` — run as
//! an out-of-process subprocess, **discovered at runtime, never vendored or
//! linked** — and consumes only its processed output URL. The resolved
//! `*.googlevideo.com` HLS master is then fed into the standard HLS ingest path; a
//! `YouTube` source is a thin wrapper over `hls`.
//!
//! ## Split: pure core vs subprocess shell
//!
//! * [`resolve`] — the **pure** core (this is the correctness load, ADR-0015
//!   phase P0): [`parse_info_dict`] turns a `yt-dlp -J` JSON info-dict into a
//!   [`ResolvedHls`], classifies [`LiveStatus`], and [`parse_expire`] reads the
//!   `expire` deadline off a resolved URL. No network, no subprocess — fully
//!   fixture- and property-tested.
//! * [`process`] — the thin subprocess shell: discover and spawn `yt-dlp` with an
//!   argument vector (no shell), a hard timeout (a hung process is killed, not
//!   awaited — invariant #10), captured stderr, and the `web_safari` player
//!   client pinned.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariants #1 / #2 / #10)
//!
//! Resolution and the (later) re-resolution loop run **off the data plane**. A
//! resolution failure degrades the *tile* (LIVE → STALE → `NO_SIGNAL`) and raises
//! an operator alarm; it never stalls the output clock. Re-resolution before the
//! `expire` deadline and the make-before-break URL swap are a later item; this
//! module supplies the resolver core they build on.
//!
//! ## Licensing and terms of service
//!
//! `yt-dlp` is public-domain (Unlicense) and run as a subprocess, so no linking
//! or copyleft obligation attaches; the default Multiview build excludes the
//! feature entirely (LGPL-clean by construction). Cookies, when used, are
//! secret-ref only (ADR-M006). Lawful use is the operator's responsibility
//! (ADR-0015 §7).
