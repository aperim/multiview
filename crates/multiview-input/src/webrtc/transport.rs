//! WebRTC ingest transport — **feature `webrtc`**.
//!
//! This module owns the *testable core* of a WebRTC receive session: the
//! connection-state lifecycle, the application-layer **[`MediaEngine`] seam** that
//! a concrete ICE/DTLS/SRTP engine plugs into, the H.264 RTP **depacketize ->
//! access-unit** seam ([`H264Depacketizer`]), and the [`WebRtcProducer`]: an
//! honest **compressed media-event producer** that turns decrypted RTP into
//! typed [`MediaEvent`]s — keyframe-gated H.264 access units and Opus audio
//! frames — for the application layer to decode (ADR-T014: decode happens
//! there, and frame geometry/color come from the decoder's SPS/VUI, never
//! from anything declared here).
//!
//! ## No native WebRTC library here (pure / LGPL-clean default)
//!
//! `multiview-input` is `unsafe_code = forbid` and pulls in **no** native WebRTC
//! crate. The real ICE candidate gathering, DTLS handshake, and SRTP
//! depacketization need a network + crypto stack; per the module design that
//! engine is supplied by the **application layer** behind the off-by-default
//! `webrtc` feature (e.g. a sans-IO `str0m`-based driver wired at the binary
//! level). This crate defines the [`MediaEngine`] trait it drives and the pure
//! RTP -> frame adapter; the socket/crypto path is never linked here, keeping the
//! default build pure-Rust.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariants #1 / #2 / #10)
//!
//! A WebRTC source is **sampled, never pacing**: the [`WebRtcProducer`] only ever
//! *pulls* from the engine and yields what is ready; it never blocks the output
//! clock. The depacketizers are pure state machines over injected packets with
//! **bounded** buffers that drop, never grow. A dead or lagging engine yields
//! `None`/`Pending` and is held — it cannot stall the engine.
