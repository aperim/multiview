//! ST 2110 receive-bridge **genuine drop-oldest** regression (ADR-0033 §7).
//!
//! The `channel_bridge` seam between the async NIC receive task and the sync
//! `St2110Producer` must, when its bounded queue is full, drop the **oldest**
//! queued packet and retain the **newest** — for live media the freshest data
//! is what matters, and a stalled reader must never back-pressure the receive
//! task (invariant #10). ADR-0033 §7 records that the original bridge dropped
//! the *newest* on a full channel (an mpsc `try_send` failure discarded the
//! just-arrived unit); this test pins the corrected behaviour.
//!
//! Gated behind `st2110` (the receive-transport feature that owns the bridge).
