//! Frame-assembler tests for the ST 2110-20 receive path (IN-1).
//!
//! The assembler takes the stream of depacketized [`V20Payload`] SRD segments
//! plus the RTP marker bit / 90 kHz timestamp / sequence number and reassembles
//! them into a single raster, closing a frame on the RFC 4175 marker bit (or, if
//! the marker is lost, on the next RTP timestamp change). These golden, injected
//! sequences are the testable core: a full in-order frame assembles; an
//! out-of-order or missing sequence is detected and surfaced as a discontinuity;
//! the marker bit closes the frame; a timestamp change flushes the previous
//! (possibly partial) frame. Real NIC/PTP RX (IN-2) is out of scope here.
