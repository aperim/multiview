//! Acceptance test for the NDI® runtime license gate on the **ingest** side
//! (ADR-0008 §7.5) — the receive mirror of
//! `multiview-output/tests/ndi_license_gate.rs`.
//!
//! With the license **not accepted**, no [`NdiProducer`] is constructed and the
//! receive seam is **never sampled** — a typed refusal, never a panic, never a
//! started source (the output-clock invariant is untouched; the tile degrades).
//! With acceptance, the producer opens and samples. The gate is enforced **by
//! construction**: the producer's start/constructor require an accepted
//! [`NdiLicense`], and the only way to obtain one is through an audited acceptance
//! record (who/when).
#![cfg(feature = "ndi")]
#![allow(
    // reason: integration test; the strict workspace lints are relaxed for
    // `tests/` per CLAUDE.md.
