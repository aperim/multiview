//! GPU image-primitive upload bookkeeping for the overlay sub-pass (feature
//! `overlay` + `wgpu`): the content-keyed texture cache and the CPU-checkable
//! seams (premultiply-fade math + nearest-neighbour source mapping) the GPU
//! `KIND_IMAGE` branch in `overlay.wgsl` relies on.
//!
//! A bitmap-caption / DVB-sub cue (`OverlayPrimitive::Image`) carries an
//! **already-premultiplied** RGBA buffer (the shape `multiview_ffmpeg::caption::
//! CueBitmap` emits). The GPU path uploads each *unique* cue bitmap into one
//! layer of an `Rgba8Unorm` texture-array exactly **once**, then samples it in
//! the shader every frame it is visible — so a static caption that persists for
//! many ticks is uploaded once, not per-frame (invariant #5/#6 spirit, ADR-0016
//! "keyed by content revision/hash, never per frame"; ADR-E005 bounded memory).
//!
//! There is **no GPU adapter at runtime here**, so the cache bookkeeping (which
//! layer a content key maps to, upload-once vs reuse, bounded LRU eviction) is
//! pure-Rust and unit-tested on the CPU; the matching `textureLoad` runs only on
//! a GPU-tagged self-hosted runner and is validated SSIM/PSNR vs the CPU
//! reference [`crate::overlay::subpass::blend_overlays`] (never bit-exact).
