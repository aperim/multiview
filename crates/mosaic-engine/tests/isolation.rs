//! Isolation chaos tests — invariant #10 (the engine can never be
//! back-pressured by a client).
//!
//! THE chaos property: a subscriber that never reads (or reads arbitrarily
//! slowly, or crashes, or holds any lock it can reach) cannot slow the engine's
//! publish path. We assert that publishing to both isolation channels — the
//! wait-free latest-state slot and the drop-oldest event broadcast — completes
//! in bounded time regardless of consumer behaviour, that a lagging subscriber
//! observes drop-oldest (`Lagged`) rather than ever stalling the publisher, and
//! that every event carries a strictly-increasing sequence number for resume.
//!
//! The previous implementation guarded a `VecDeque` ring with a `std::sync::Mutex`
//! shared between `publish()` and the consumers' `try_recv()`/`drain()`/`pending()`;
//! a consumer holding that lock back-pressured the engine. These tests now run
//! against the lock-free / `broadcast`-based replacement, which has no such lock.
