//! The admission + **resource-adaptive degradation** control loop (invariant
//! #9).
//!
//! A closed control loop runs on the engine's *slow* control tick (not the
//! per-frame output clock):
//!
//! 1. **Sense** — read a normalized `0.0..=1.0` pressure signal. The default
//!    derivation ([`ControlLoop::pressure_from_plan`]) is the worst per-engine
//!    utilization from the [`Planner`]'s cost model (decode/composite/encode
//!    Mpix/s vs budget); a real deployment refines it with measured telemetry.
//! 2. **Estimate** — the [`Planner`] (HAL cost model) turns a candidate plan
//!    into per-stage usage; admission (`admit`) is the hard gate at start time.
//! 3. **Plan** — the [`Hysteresis`](mosaic_hal::degradation::Hysteresis) controller (inside the planner) maps the
//!    pressure reading to a single, non-flapping ladder move per tick. Shedding
//!    is prompt; recovery waits out a dwell/cooldown so a noisy signal cannot
//!    oscillate the plan.
//! 4. **Apply** — the active level selects the cumulative
//!    [`DegradationAction`] set, applied **cheapest-impact-first, tile-by-tile,
//!    before the program output everyone sees is ever touched**
//!    (`affects_program()` marks the boundary). Bounded queues drop, never grow.
//!
//! This module is a thin, deterministic orchestrator over `mosaic-hal`; all the
//! ladder semantics and the anti-flap math live there and are reused verbatim
//! (no duplication).
