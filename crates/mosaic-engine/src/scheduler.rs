//! Time- and event-triggered **automation scheduler**: a cron-like / interval
//! timeline plus on-alarm / on-cue triggers that produce salvo (and other
//! command) actions over an injected [`MediaTime`] (broadcast-multiviewer brief
//! §8, ADR-MV001).
//!
//! The scheduler answers one question per control tick: *given the current media
//! time and any events that occurred, which automation actions should fire now?*
//! It is the pure decision layer above the [`salvo`](crate::salvo) engine — it
//! decides *when* a named salvo (or other action) should be triggered; the salvo
//! engine decides *what* changes that produces.
//!
//! Two trigger families:
//!
//! * **Time triggers** — fire on a fixed **interval** measured from a base
//!   instant (a robust, drift-free stand-in for cron on a media timeline: "every
//!   N nanoseconds"). Edge-detected against the injected clock so each due
//!   instant fires exactly once even when control ticks are coarse or bursty.
//! * **Event triggers** — fire when a named event is reported this tick
//!   (on-alarm, on-cue, on-GPI).
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #1 + #10)
//!
//! [`Scheduler::tick`] is a pure function of `(now, events)` that **returns** the
//! [`ScheduledAction`]s to apply; it never reaches into the engine, blocks, or
//! `.await`s. The engine polls it on its slow control tick and applies any
//! returned actions at a frame boundary — a stalled scheduler tick simply defers
//! the decision, never a frame.
