//! The tally **profile**: the configurable bit↔colour and index↔tile mappings
//! that turn an external tally bus's wire vocabulary into Mosaic's per-tile
//! [`TallyState`] (broadcast-multiviewer brief §2, ADR-MV001).
//!
//! An external switcher/router/GPI bus speaks in *its own* numbering: a router
//! crosspoint index, a GPI pin number, an IS-07 source label. The profile is the
//! pure, serialisable lookup table the [`arbiter`](crate::tally::arbiter) consults
//! to answer two questions for each incoming tally fact:
//!
//! * **bit → colour**: which [`TallyColor`] does a given bus *bit* light? (PGM is
//!   conventionally red, PVW green, an aux/ISO bus amber — but it is configurable.)
//! * **index → tile**: which mosaic tile does a given bus *element index* drive?
//!
//! Everything here is a pure value type — no I/O, no clock, no channel — so the
//! whole mapping is exhaustively property-testable.
