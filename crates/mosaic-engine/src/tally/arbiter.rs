//! The tally **arbiter**: aggregate many tally sources (PGM/PVW/ME/aux/router/
//! GPI/IS-07) into one resolved per-tile [`TallyState`] under a defined
//! conflict-resolution policy (broadcast-multiviewer brief §2, ADR-MV001).
//!
//! A facility tallies the *same* element from several independent buses at once:
//! a production switcher's PGM and PVW, a router crosspoint, a GPI closure, an
//! IS-07 event. They disagree — PGM says red, an ISO bus says amber. The arbiter
//! is the pure value machine that, given the set of [`TallyFact`]s asserted for a
//! tile this tick, picks the **one** winning [`TallyState`] under a configured
//! [`ConflictPolicy`], optionally **latching** the last lit state so a momentary
//! glitch does not blink the lamp.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #1 + #10)
//!
//! Like the rest of the M11 control surface, the arbiter is a pure
//! classify-style machine over an injected [`MediaTime`] (mirroring
//! [`mosaic_framestore::state`] and the alarm engine). [`TallyArbiter::resolve`]
//! **returns** the resolved per-tile states; it never reaches into the engine,
//! never sends on a channel and never blocks. The engine samples it on its slow
//! control tick and renders the result via `mosaic-overlay` at a frame boundary —
//! it can therefore never stall the output clock or back-pressure anything.
