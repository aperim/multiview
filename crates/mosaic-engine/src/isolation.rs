//! Outbound **isolation** wiring (invariant #10).
//!
//! The engine publishes its state and telemetry to control, preview, and
//! realtime consumers **only** through channels whose publish path is
//! *physically incapable* of being blocked by any consumer:
//!
//! * **Latest-state slot** ([`LatestState`]): a single-slot, newest-wins cell
//!   backed by [`arc_swap::ArcSwapOption`] (the same primitive
//!   `mosaic-framestore` uses). The publisher's [`LatestState::publish`] is a
//!   single atomic `store` — **wait-free**: it acquires no lock, never spins on
//!   a reader, and cannot be made to wait by any number of concurrent readers. A
//!   consumer that never reads simply misses intermediate snapshots; it can
//!   never make the publisher wait.
//! * **Event stream** ([`EventStream`] / [`EventSubscription`]): a fixed-capacity
//!   ring built on [`tokio::sync::broadcast`]. The publisher's
//!   [`EventStream::publish`] calls `broadcast::Sender::send`, which **never
//!   awaits and never blocks on a slow or absent receiver**. When a subscriber
//!   falls behind, the channel overwrites the oldest buffered events
//!   (drop-oldest) and that subscriber observes a [`RecvError::Lagged`] reporting
//!   how many it missed — it never back-pressures the sender. Every event
//!   carries a strictly increasing **sequence number** so a reconnecting
//!   consumer can detect gaps and resume.
//!
//! Crucially there is **no consumer-callable method that takes a lock the
//! publisher also needs**. The previous implementation guarded a `VecDeque` ring
//! with a `std::sync::Mutex` shared between the publisher's `publish()` and the
//! consumers' `try_recv()`/`drain()`/`pending()`; a consumer holding (or
//! preempted while holding) that lock would stall the engine's publish path,
//! violating invariant #10. That mutex ring has been removed entirely.
//!
//! The chaos property the tests prove: a subscriber that never reads (or reads
//! arbitrarily slowly, or holds any lock it can reach, or crashes) **cannot**
//! slow the publisher. `publish` on either channel completes in bounded time
//! regardless of consumer behaviour; slow consumers lag and lose the oldest
//! items rather than blocking the engine or growing memory without bound.
