//! **Round-robin tile cycling** and **freeze / reference-still** tile modes, as
//! pure value machines over an injected [`MediaTime`] (broadcast-multiviewer brief
//! §1, ADR-MV001).
//!
//! A cycling tile shows one source from a rotating roster, advancing on a fixed
//! dwell so a single cell can survey many sources. A frozen tile holds a captured
//! reference still instead of live video (for an A/B reference or to park a flaky
//! feed). Both are decisions the engine samples on its control tick and applies at
//! a frame boundary.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #1 + #10)
//!
//! [`RoundRobin::tick`] and [`FreezeTile`] are pure functions over an injected
//! [`MediaTime`]; they **return** the source/freeze state for the engine to apply
//! and never block, `.await`, or reach into the engine. Cycling is deterministic:
//! the same dwell and clock always yield the same rotation.
