//! The M9 **high-availability** model: an active/standby + N+1 instance model
//! with a heartbeat health-check state machine, an automatic output-failover
//! policy, and a state-replication model (FEATURES.md M9 "System redundancy:
//! hot-standby / N+1 / failover"; resilience-and-av §2).
//!
//! Three pure layers:
//!
//! * **Heartbeat / health-check** — peers exchange [`Heartbeat`]s; each node runs
//!   a pure [`HaStateMachine`] over an injected
//!   [`MediaTime`]. When the active's heartbeats
//!   miss a configured threshold, the standby **promotes** (begins driving
//!   output) — make-before-break, so output never falters at the model level.
//! * **Failover policy** — [`FailoverPolicy`] + [`Cluster`] decide *which* node
//!   drives output. The election is a pure, deterministic function of cluster
//!   health (liveness, [`Priority`], [`NodeId`]) so every survivor computes the
//!   **same** winner and cannot disagree — the root of the no-split-brain
//!   guarantee. An [`Epoch`] (a monotonic promotion generation) fences zombie
//!   actives: a higher epoch is authoritative, a lower epoch is ignored.
//! * **State replication** — [`repl`] is the serializable engine-state snapshot
//!   plus the contiguous deltas the active replicates to a standby so a promotion
//!   resumes from the right layout/source bindings.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariants #1 + #10) — HA never compromises the output clock
//!
//! This is load-bearing. On the **active** node the HA machinery is a pure value
//! machine over an injected [`MediaTime`]: it
//! samples peer heartbeats and *returns* a [`FailoverDecision`] for the control
//! plane to act on. It owns no clock, performs no I/O, never `.await`s and never
//! sends on a channel a peer can fill — exactly like the rest of the engine's
//! control surfaces. The active node's `out_pts = f(tick)` is therefore untouched
//! by anything HA does: a flapping peer, a partitioned network, or a thrashing
//! election can neither stall nor speed up the tick loop (invariant #1), and the
//! cluster path cannot back-pressure the engine (invariant #10).
//!
//! **Failover preserves output continuity (model level).** The promotion is
//! make-before-break: the moment a standby's [`HaStateMachine`] decides the
//! active is dead it *immediately* begins driving output ([`drives_output`] flips
//! to `true` on the same tick it promotes), rather than first tearing down and
//! then rebuilding. The election guarantees **at most one** node promotes and —
//! whenever any node is alive — **exactly one** node drives output, so there is no
//! window in which nobody is the program source.
//!
//! All HA arithmetic is in **integer nanoseconds** (deadlines) and integer
//! generations (epochs) — never float, consistent with invariant #3.
//!
//! [`drives_output`]: HaStateMachine::drives_output
//!
//! ## Transport is gated and compile-only
//!
//! The actual peer-to-peer heartbeat sockets and the replication wire I/O live in
//! the `transport` submodule behind the off-by-default **`cluster`** feature,
//! compiled only when that feature is enabled and compile-verified only here
//! (this environment has no live multi-node cluster). Their correctness rests on
//! the pure, fully-tested model in this module and in [`repl`].
