//! The AES67 / ST 2110-30 **sender core** (ADR-0033 §1/§7): a bounded
//! drop-oldest program-audio sink that packetizes the mixed program bus to
//! continuous marker=0 RTP.
//!
//! The engine's off-hot-path bake consumer pushes baked program
//! [`AudioBlock`]s in via [`Aes67Sender::push`] (a bounded, drop-oldest copy
//! that never blocks — invariant #10); an independent send timer drains one
//! packet-time's worth of samples per tick via [`Aes67Sender::next_packet`],
//! silence-filling any underrun so the stream is **continuous** (one valid
//! marker=0 packet per tick forever — invariant #1). The two run on independent
//! clocks and the sender can never back-pressure or re-pace the engine.
//!
//! Timestamps advance by **sample-groups** (`+frames_per_packet` per packet,
//! e.g. `+48` at 1 ms / 48 kHz), never by bytes or channels; the sequence
//! advances `+1` per packet; the SSRC is a constant chosen at construction.
//! (The PTP-anchored *absolute* send timestamp — ADR-0033 §4 — is a flagged
//! hardware follow-on; this software sender uses a free-running counter, which
//! preserves the continuous cadence and never paces the engine.)
