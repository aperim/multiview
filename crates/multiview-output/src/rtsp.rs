//! RTSP egress — the OUT-1 **sidecar baseline** publish seam.
//!
//! # The decision (ADR-0006)
//!
//! Two RTSP egress paths exist in the design:
//!
//! * **Primary (OUT-2):** an in-process `gst-rtsp-server` that fans the
//!   already-encoded canvas to RTSP clients with no re-encode. It pulls the
//!   GStreamer/GLib C stack, so it lives behind a future `rtsp` Cargo feature and
//!   is **not** this module.
//! * **Baseline (OUT-1, here):** the **publish hop** — libav RTSP ANNOUNCE/RECORD
//!   to a *listening* RTSP endpoint such as a local
//!   [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx) sidecar. This reuses the
//!   existing `PushProtocol::Rtsp` push
//!   transport (which already maps to libav's `rtsp` muxer) — **zero new sink
//!   code** — and stays LGPL-clean and native-light (no `GLib`).
//!
//! This module owns the one piece the baseline still needs: a typed,
//! pure-Rust way to derive the publish URL from a configured base + mount. It is
//! **always compiled** (no `ffmpeg`/native dependency, so it is always
//! CI-tested); the coupling to the push transport — selecting
//! `PushProtocol::Rtsp` — is the only part
//! gated behind the `ffmpeg` feature.
//!
//! # The publish URL
//!
//! A deploy configures a publish *base* (host + port of the RTSP sidecar, e.g.
//! the `MediaMTX` default `rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554`) and each output names a *mount*
//! (the RTSP path the program is published under). [`RtspPublishTarget`] joins
//! them into the `rtsp://host:port/mount` URL the `PushSink`
//! opens, using **checked string formatting only** — no panics, no indexing, no
//! `as` casts (guardrails). The base must be an RTSP(S) scheme with no path of its
//! own; the mount must be a non-empty, whitespace-free RTSP path.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! The published stream is the **same** one-encode canvas the file/HLS/UDP sinks
//! carry (invariant #7) — this seam only chooses *where* to push it. A dropped or
//! absent RTSP sidecar surfaces as a typed
//! [`Error::Output`](crate::Error::Output) at connect time on the push sink's own
//! thread; it never stalls the output clock (#1) or back-pressures the engine
//! (#10), exactly like every other `PushSink` target.
