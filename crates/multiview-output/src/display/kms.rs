//! The real DRM/KMS backend (feature `display-kms`): drm-rs 0.15 atomic
//! commits + GBM/dumb-buffer scanout allocation, implementing [`KmsBackend`]
//! for the hardware-free sink loop in [`super::sink`].
//!
//! **Hardware-only module.** Everything here speaks real ioctls against
//! `/dev/dri/cardN`; CI compiles it (the feature build gate) but exercises it
//! only on hardware — the sink's behaviour (conflation, EBUSY, modeset
//! discipline) is CI-proven through the scripted mock instead. All code is
//! safe Rust: drm-rs is a pure-ioctl safe wrapper, and GBM GEM handles are
//! obtained via prime-fd export/import rather than the C union accessor.
//!
//! ## Frame path — the per-hardware buffer strategy (DEV-B3, brief §2)
//!
//! On first frame the backend resolves the head's
//! [`BufferStrategy`](super::strategy::BufferStrategy) from the probed primary
//! plane's formats/modifiers (`get_plane` + the `IN_FORMATS` blob), the
//! canvas's delivery shape ([`DisplayCanvas::delivery`]), and whether a wgpu
//! importer is wired (see the wgpu-version verdict below). Three paths:
//!
//! * **NV12-direct** (Intel Gen9+ / vc4, incl. the SAND128 modifier): the
//!   canvas's NV12/P010 dmabuf is `prime_fd_to_buffer`-imported and turned into
//!   a planar framebuffer (`add_planar_framebuffer`, `ADDFB2` with modifiers)
//!   that is flipped straight onto the plane — **0 copies, 0 render passes**.
//!   This is drm/gbm-only (no wgpu, no `unsafe`) and runs on the current pin.
//! * **CPU NV12→XRGB** (the guaranteed default, DEV-B1): the CPU conversion
//!   ([`super::canvas::nv12_to_xrgb`], BT.709 limited→full, 8.8 integer) into a
//!   double-buffered XRGB8888 scanout pool — GBM-allocated
//!   (`SCANOUT | WRITE | LINEAR`) where a Mesa GBM backend exists, KMS **dumb
//!   buffers** otherwise (NVIDIA, or no GBM).
//! * **wgpu NV12→XRGB pass** (AMD DCE11 with a GPU): see the verdict below —
//!   **not wired in this crate on the current wgpu pin**; the selector never
//!   resolves to it here, and the backend treats it as the CPU path.
//!
//! ## wgpu-version verdict (DEV-B3) — dmabuf import is deferred; CPU path ships
//!
//! Verified against the workspace pin **wgpu 29.0.3** (the compositor's pin):
//!
//! * `wgpu::SurfaceTargetUnsafe::Drm` **exists** (the NVIDIA tier-2
//!   DRM-surface path) and `wgpu::Device::create_texture_from_hal` **exists**.
//! * `wgpu_hal::vulkan::Device::texture_from_raw(.., external_memory_image_create_info)`
//!   **exists** — the dmabuf-import primitive — but there is **no** safe
//!   high-level `texture_from_dmabuf_fd` in wgpu 29 (that lands in a later
//!   release). Importing an NV12 dmabuf as a wgpu texture on this pin therefore
//!   requires `wgpu-hal` + `ash` as new **direct** deps of `multiview-output`
//!   and a block of raw-Vulkan `unsafe` (build a `vk::Image` with
//!   `VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier`, import the fd via
//!   `VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf`).
//! * **Verdict: the wgpu render pass is deferred — the CPU NV12→XRGB path is
//!   the shipped AMD/fallback default**, for two reasons honestly stated:
//!   (1) pulling raw-Vulkan `unsafe` into this `forbid(unsafe_code)` crate to
//!   hand-roll dmabuf import is not warranted while the CPU path is correct and
//!   the AMD budget (~0.7 GB/s @ 1080p60) is modest; (2) bumping the **whole
//!   workspace** wgpu to a release with safe dmabuf import risks every GPU
//!   crate and is exactly the unilateral bump DEV-B3 says not to make. The
//!   selector's `WgpuXrgbPass` variant + the `gpu_pass_available` seam compile
//!   and are unit-tested; flipping the seam on is a localized follow-up when
//!   the workspace wgpu pin advances (or a dmabuf-canvas reaches a vc4/Intel
//!   target, where NV12-direct skips the pass entirely).
//!
//! [`BufferStrategy`]: super::strategy::BufferStrategy
//! [`DisplayCanvas::delivery`]: super::canvas::DisplayCanvas::delivery
