//! Bounded drop-oldest audio FIFO (DEV-B4 / invariants #1 + #10).
//!
//! The display-audio sink is a *consumer*. The engine's program-audio bus pushes
//! blocks in; the sink thread drains them to the ALSA PCM. The two run on
//! independent clocks, so this FIFO decouples them — and it is the structural
//! guarantee that audio can never back-pressure the engine: [`AudioFifo::push`]
//! is wait-free and bounded. When full it drops the **oldest** samples (so a
//! late reader gets fresh audio, not stale backlog) and records the drop count
//! as telemetry. It never grows and the writer never blocks.
//!
//! Interleaved 32-bit float, frame-major (matching multiview-audio's
//! [`AudioBlock`](multiview_audio::AudioBlock)). Capacity and fill are measured
//! in **frames** (samples per channel) so they are channel-count independent and
//! map directly onto the servo's fill fraction.
