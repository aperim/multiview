//! The buffer-level servo (DEV-B4 / display-out §5: the three-clock servo).
//!
//! Three independent crystals meet at the display-audio sink: the engine tick,
//! the display **pixel** clock (observed through the flip timestamps the sink
//! exports — `display::sink` `last_flip_ns`), and the ALSA **sample** clock.
//! They drift at ppm levels, so a fixed resample ratio would slowly over- or
//! under-fill the audio FIFO and walk AV sync off the scanout clock. The servo
//! closes that loop: it watches the FIFO fill level (the fast, local error) plus
//! the long-run sample-vs-flip skew (the slow, absolute error) and emits a
//! resample-ratio correction in ppm. The display-audio sink feeds that ratio to
//! multiview-audio's [`AdaptiveResampler`](multiview_audio::AdaptiveResampler) —
//! the mpv/Kodi "display-resample" technique — so the resampler, not new
//! machinery, does the rate adjustment.
//!
//! It is a small **PI controller** on the fill error with a proportional skew
//! bias, all clamped to the resampler's audible band
//! ([`RatioPpm::MAX_PPM`](multiview_audio::RatioPpm::MAX_PPM)). Pure arithmetic —
//! fully unit-testable, no hardware.
