//! (ADR-0044 §1).
//!
//! The loop is generic over [`KmsBackend`], so its entire behaviour —
//! conflation, EBUSY handling, no-new-frame repeat, modeset discipline — is
//! CI-tested over a scripted mock; only the [`super::kms`] backend touches
//! hardware. The engine side holds just a [`FramePublisher`] (wait-free); the

//! (invariants #1 + #10) — its failure mode is a frozen monitor showing the
//! last framebuffer while program output continues untouched.
