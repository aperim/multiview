//! Display-sink mailbox tests (DEV-B1 / ADR-0044, invariants #1 + #10): the
//! wait-free latest-frame mailbox between the engine's canvas publish and the
//! display sink thread. The writer must NEVER block — regardless of whether the
//! reader drains — and the reader always observes the newest published frame.
//! Pure Rust, no hardware.
