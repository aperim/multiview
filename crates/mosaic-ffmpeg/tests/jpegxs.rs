//! Integration coverage for the JPEG XS (ST 2110-22) capability probe against
//! the **linked** `FFmpeg`.
//!
//! Two layers:
//!
//! * The **pure** path-selection algorithm is unit-tested inline in
//!   `src/jpegxs.rs`; here we additionally exercise it through the crate's
//!   public surface so the re-exports stay wired.
//! * The **gated** `probe`/`is_available` run only under the `ffmpeg` feature.
//!   In this environment `FFmpeg` 7.1 has no JPEG XS codec, so the only thing
//!   asserted at runtime is the contract that matters most: the probe **falls
//!   back cleanly** (no panic, no error) and reports unavailable. On a build
//!   that *does* ship JPEG XS, the same call would instead name the codec — the
//!   test asserts the invariant (availability ⇒ a JPEG XS codec name) that holds
//!   either way.
