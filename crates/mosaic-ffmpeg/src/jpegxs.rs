//! ST 2110-22 **JPEG XS** (ISO/IEC 21122, VSF TR-08) codec support and
//! capability detection.
//!
//! ST 2110-22 carries *lightly-compressed* video over IP; JPEG XS is the codec
//! used in practice. Whether a usable JPEG XS decoder/encoder exists depends
//! entirely on **how the linked `FFmpeg` was built** — JPEG XS support arrived
//! in FFmpeg after the 7.1 line this crate validates against, and it may be
//! provided either by a native `jpegxs` decoder/encoder or by the external
//! `libsvtjpegxs` wrapper. So a usable JPEG XS path can never be assumed at
//! compile time; it must be **detected at runtime against the real build** and
//! fall back cleanly when absent.
//!
//! ## What is pure vs. gated
//!
//! This module is split so the decision logic is testable without any native
//! dependency:
//!
//! * **Pure (always compiled, unit-tested):** the canonical list of libav codec
//!   *names* to probe for JPEG XS ([`JPEGXS_CODEC_NAMES`]), the
//!   [`JpegXsRole`]/[`JpegXsAvailability`] value types, and
//!   [`select_codec_name`] — the path-selection algorithm that, given the raw
//!   "is each candidate present?" answers from a probe, picks the codec name to
//!   use (highest-priority present one) or reports unavailability. None of this
//!   touches libav.
//! * **Gated (`ffmpeg` feature, compile-verified here only):** `probe` /
//!   `is_available` (named as plain code spans because they are absent from the
//!   default pure-Rust doc build), which run [`select_codec_name`] against the
//!   **linked** `FFmpeg` by asking libav `avcodec_find_{decoder,encoder}_by_name`.
//!   Because the `FFmpeg` in this environment has no JPEG XS codec, these report
//!   "unavailable" rather than panicking.
//!
//! ## Why name-based, not `AVCodecID`-based
//!
//! The `ffmpeg-next` 7.1 binding's `Id` enum has **no** JPEG XS variant (it
//! predates `AV_CODEC_ID_JPEGXS`), so an id-based lookup cannot even name the
//! codec. Probing by the registered *codec name*
//! (`"jpegxs"`, `"libsvtjpegxs"`, …) is both expressible today and
//! forward-compatible: it starts working the moment a future linked `FFmpeg`
//! registers such a codec, with no change to the binding or this crate.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! JPEG XS only ever appears as a per-input *codec*; it does not change Mosaic's
//! timing model. A JPEG XS source is decoded into the normal NV12 timeline and
//! sampled by the compositor like any other input (invariants #1/#5) — detection
//! here selects a decoder; it never paces the output clock.
