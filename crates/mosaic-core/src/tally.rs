//! Shared tally vocabulary (TSL UMD palette, brightness, bus sources).
//!
//! This module pins the broadcast tally **type foundation** (broadcast-
//! multiviewer brief §2). The TSL UMD protocol family carries per-element tally
//! as a 2-bit colour (`0 = off`, `1 = red`, `2 = green`, `3 = amber`) and a
//! 2-bit brightness. These pure value types are consumed later by
//! `mosaic-overlay` (tally borders / UMD rendering), `mosaic-engine` (the tally
//! arbiter), and `mosaic-control` (TSL ingest/egress). No I/O, no protocol
//! framing — those belong to the TSL codecs in `mosaic-input`/`mosaic-output`.
