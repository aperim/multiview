//! Minimal safe wrapper over the Linux **i915 PMU per-engine busy-ns counter**.
//!
//! On Intel GPUs the per-engine encoder/decoder utilisation that NVML exposes
//! directly (and that DRM `fdinfo` exposes only per-process) is published by the
//! kernel as a **whole-device** counter through the i915 *performance monitoring
//! unit* (PMU): `perf_event_open(2)` on the i915 PMU `type` with an engine-class
//! `config` returns a file descriptor whose `read(2)` yields a monotonically
//! increasing **busy-nanoseconds** total for that engine class
//! ([gpu-monitoring §1, §2.1](../../../docs/research/gpu-monitoring-and-scheduling.md),
//! [I1][I2]). A busy *fraction* is the delta of two reads over the wall interval
//! between them — exactly the two-snapshot diff the AMD fdinfo path uses.
//!
//! `perf_event_open` is a raw syscall that needs `unsafe`, and `libc` 0.2 does
//! not carry a `perf_event_attr` struct, so this tiny leaf crate declares the
//! minimal `#[repr(C)]` attribute layout itself and owns the counter lifecycle
//! behind a safe, `Option`-returning API. The three `unsafe` blocks are exactly
//! that lifecycle and nothing more — the `perf_event_open` syscall the crate
//! exists to isolate, the counter `read(2)`, and the fd `close(2)` on `Drop` —
//! each with its own `// SAFETY:` justification. It is the only place in the
//! workspace — besides the libav-owning `multiview-ffmpeg` and the
//! `adjtimex`-owning `multiview-ntpsys` — that relaxes `unsafe_code` from
//! `forbid` to `deny`. `multiview-hal` stays `forbid(unsafe_code)` and consumes
//! the safe snapshot.
//!
//! ## Pure, always-compiled core
//!
//! The engine-class config encoding ([`engine_busy_config`]) and the
//! busy-ns → fraction two-snapshot diff ([`busy_fraction`]) are pure, have no
//! native deps, and are unit-tested on fixture counters on **every** target. The
//! live counter ([`I915PmuCounter`]) is `cfg(target_os = "linux")`.
//!
//! ## Live-gated
//!
//! Opening a counter needs a real i915 device **and** `perf_event_open`
//! permission (`CAP_PERFMON` / a low enough `perf_event_paranoid`); a CI
//! container typically lacks both. So [`I915PmuCounter::open`] returns `None` on
//! any error — non-Linux target, no i915 PMU, `EACCES`/`EPERM`, or a short read —
//! never a panic and never a block. The live `perf_event_open` test is gated; the
//! pure encoding and diff are tested everywhere.
//!
//! ## Non-Linux
//!
//! On any non-Linux target the crate still compiles; [`I915PmuCounter::open`]
//! returns `None` (the probe then leaves the Intel per-engine fields unknown).
