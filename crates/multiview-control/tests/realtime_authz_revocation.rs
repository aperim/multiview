//! Live authorization revocation on established WS/SSE sessions (ADR-RT010).
//!
//! WS/SSE capture the principal's role + object scope at CONNECT only, so a
//! mid-session scope narrow/widen, role downgrade, or key revoke used to keep
//! delivering now-unauthorized deltas (and keep the client displaying now-hidden
//! cached objects) until the client happened to reconnect. This closes the gap:
//! `ApiKeyStore` is the interior-mutable source of truth with a wait-free
//! generation counter, and each session (store-managed API-key principals only)
//! re-resolves on a generation change — narrowing/widening yields a `$resync`
//! rebuild directive, loss of read access yields a forced disconnect.
//!
//! These tests drive `SessionStream` + `ApiKeyStore` directly — the
//! transport-agnostic core both `run_ws_session` and `sse_handler` share —
//! exactly like `tests/realtime_watermark.rs`.
