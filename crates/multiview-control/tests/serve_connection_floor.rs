//! The control-plane serve loop is **HTTP/1-only** and enforces an accept-level
//! connection population cap (SEC-14 #126 R2 / [ADR-W031](../../docs/decisions/ADR-W031.md)).
//!
//! These are the round-2 hardening tests on top of the header-read timeout
//! (`serve_header_timeout.rs`):
//!
//! * **F1 — HTTP/2 is refused.** The header-read timeout only bounds HTTP/1 header
//!   reads; hyper's HTTP/2 server has no equivalent, so an HTTP/2 connection (which
//!   the old `auto` builder would negotiate on the h2 preface) could pin a slot
//!   forever. Serving on `hyper::server::conn::http1::Builder` subjects *every*
//!   connection — the h2 preface included — to the header-read timeout, so a slot
//!   can never be held open past the deadline.
//! * **F2 — accept-level population cap.** A flood of half-open connections is bounded
//!   at accept (global + per-IP), before any request headers parse.
//! * **F3 — bounded drain.** At shutdown, in-flight connection tasks are tracked and
//!   aborted after a ceiling, so none outlives `serve`.
