//! Whole-system-artifact authorization across **every** scope axis (ADR-W026,
//! auth-panel / SEC-10).
//!
//! `require_unscoped_for_whole_system` confines the whole-system desired-state
//! surfaces — `GET /config/export` (embeds every device/`device_ref`/sync-group
//! member id), and the config-state mutations `POST /config/revert-to-start` and
//! `POST /config/promote` (rewrite the ENTIRE running/boot document across all
//! objects) — to a principal that can see the whole system. A principal
//! restricted on ANY axis (object, output, OR discovery-domain) must be denied:
//! a per-field redaction cannot apply to a whole-system document, and a scoped
//! operator has no business rewriting state for objects outside its allowlist.
//!
//! The guard is generalized to the unified `is_global` predicate — NOT a frozen
//! object-only (or object-or-output) check — so an output-only-scoped or a
//! discovery-domain-only-scoped principal cannot bypass it.
//!
//! It also runs FIRST — before the boot-model lookup, idempotency reservation,
//! config composition, command submit, or file write. The positive control
//! proves this: an UNSCOPED operator on `revert`/`promote` (harness has no boot
//! model) reaches the boot-model check and gets `409`, while a scoped operator
//! is stopped at `403` before it — if the guard ran after the boot-model lookup,
//! the scoped operator would also see `409`.
