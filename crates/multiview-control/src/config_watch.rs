//! Config-file watch (ADR-W020): hot-reload the impacted parts of the boot
//! config when the file changes on disk — through the SAME apply machinery the
//! Web/API uses — and change NOTHING when the new document is invalid.
//!
//! The watcher is a control-plane tokio task (never on the render thread):
//! it polls the config **path** (re-`stat` each tick, so a write-temp +
//! `rename(2)` lands as a normal change) and acts only on a fingerprint that
//! is **stable across two consecutive polls** (editors multi-write; the file
//! must settle first). On a debounced change it reparses + revalidates the
//! WHOLE document:
//!
//! * **invalid** ⇒ `tracing::warn!`, a latched `config-file-invalid` health
//!   warning on the engine's drop-oldest publisher (the UI banner + `GET
//!   /api/v1/health` surface), a `last_rejected` watch-status record — and
//!   **no state change anywhere** (the run keeps the last-good document);
//! * **valid** ⇒ a pure per-section [`ConfigDiff`] against the RUNNING
//!   baseline, applied through the one machinery: synthetic source
//!   adds/edits and any source removal ride `UpsertSource`/`RemoveSource` on
//!   the bounded command bus (ADR-W018), a layout/cells change rides the
//!   shared resolve+solve+Class-1-gate and `ApplyLayout` (ADR-W019), and
//!   every section without a live path reseeds its control store (the UI's
//!   truth) and latches a `config-file-requires-restart` warning naming it.
//!   The new file then becomes the baseline.
//!
//! Isolation (invariants #1 + #10): every engine submission is the
//! non-blocking `try_submit`. A full bus sheds the submission — the watcher
//! then leaves the baseline AND the applied fingerprint **un-advanced**,
//! records a partial-apply rejection, raises the interim
//! `config-file-apply-incomplete` warning, and **re-applies the whole
//! (idempotent) change on a later poll** until every command lands; the
//! warning clears when the apply completes. Every publish is the drop-oldest
//! event broadcast, and every store touched is read-mostly control-plane
//! state. Nothing here can pace, stall, or back-pressure the output clock.
