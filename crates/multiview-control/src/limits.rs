//! Management-plane rate limiting — the keyed, lock-free rate limiter that backs
//! the SEC-14 control-plane `DoS` floor.
//!
//! This module is the **pure, clock-injected** core: a [`RateLimiter`] that
//! answers "may this key make one more request right now?" with a [`Decision`].
//! The axum middleware that keys it on the peer IP (pre-auth) and the API-key id
//! (post-auth), and the global concurrency cap, live alongside it and are wired in
//! [`crate::router`] — but the accounting here has no socket, no `AppState`, and no
//! wall clock, so it is exhaustively testable offline (the same seam pattern the
//! rest of this crate uses for clock-driven logic).
//!
//! The pre-auth per-IP guard keys on the `ConnectInfo` peer address, which is
//! installed **only** by [`crate::serve`] / [`crate::serve_router`] (via
//! `into_make_service_with_connect_info`). Serving [`crate::router`] through any
//! other make-service leaves that extension absent, silently disabling the per-IP
//! guard (it fails open — see [`per_ip_rate_limit`]); route the control plane
//! through the blessed serve helpers to keep it active.
//!
//! ## Bounded by construction — the `DoS`-resistance property
//!
//! A rate limiter that grows a per-key map is itself a memory-exhaustion vector:
//! an attacker rotating source addresses inflates the map without bound. This
//! limiter instead hashes every key into a **fixed-size table** of cells
//! ([`RateLimiter::with_hasher`] allocates the cells once and never grows), so
//! memory is `O(cells)` regardless of how many distinct keys are ever seen. Two
//! keys that hash to the same cell **share** a limiter — which can only make
//! limiting *stricter* for that pair, never looser, so the floor is preserved.
//! The hasher is seeded per process (a random [`RandomState`] in production), so
//! an attacker cannot predict or force a collision to target a specific victim.
//!
//! ## Lock-free hot path
//!
//! Each cell is a single [`AtomicU64`] holding a **theoretical arrival time**
//! (`tat`) — the virtual-scheduling (GCRA) formulation of a token bucket, its exact
//! dual: a `tat` running ahead of `now` by up to the burst tolerance `tau` is a
//! bucket that many requests below full. Because the whole per-cell state is one
//! word, [`RateLimiter::check`] is **lock-free** — a load plus a single
//! compare-and-swap, never a mutex. Under contention the CAS can fail and retry, so
//! the operation is lock-free, not wait-free; but only the *admitting* branch loops,
//! and once a cell's burst is spent every further request takes the CAS-free reject
//! path, so the retry window is bounded by the burst and can never spin unboundedly.
//! A single-key flood (which concentrates on one cell) serialises on that one atomic
//! word for a few nanoseconds and can **never park a Tokio worker holding a lock**,
//! which a blocking `std::sync::Mutex` on the async hot path could.
//!
//! ## Timekeeping
//!
//! [`RateLimiter::check`] takes the current time as an explicit monotonic
//! nanosecond count, so tests drive it deterministically; the middleware supplies
//! it from a monotonic clock. Accounting is integer-only virtual time — never float
//! — and every operation saturates, so a frozen, jumped, wrapped, or **regressed**
//! clock can neither drift, panic, nor grant a bonus (a rewound clock is absorbed
//! by `max(tat, now)`, so it never double-refills).
