//!
//! The control plane serves low-rate JPEG snapshots of the composited **program**
//! and of each **input** so the web UI can show live previews. The pixels live in
//! the engine/compositor (which this crate does not depend on), so the provider
//! is a trait the binary implements: it hands back already-encoded JPEG bytes,
//! keeping `multiview-control` free of any pixel-format or codec dependency.
//!
//! Like every other engine→control read path, a provider implementation must be
//! **isolation-safe** (invariant #10): it samples a wait-free latest-frame slot
//! and the lock-free per-input stores; it never blocks the engine. Encoding runs
//! on the request task (off the output-clock loop), not on the hot path.
