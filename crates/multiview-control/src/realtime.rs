//! Realtime fan-out: WebSocket (primary) and SSE (one-way fallback).
//!
//! The realtime layer turns the engine's drop-oldest event broadcast
//! (`EnginePublisher::events`) into a per-client stream of
//! [`Envelope<Event>`](multiview_events::Envelope) frames, following the
//! snapshot-then-delta + resume-by-seq model (ADR-RT002/RT003):
//!
//! 1. On connect the client receives a **snapshot** frame establishing the
//!    `$control` baseline (and resume cursor).
//! 2. Then a stream of **delta** frames, one per engine event.
//! 3. A reconnecting client may present a `since_seq` resume cursor; the stream
//!    replays only events strictly after it (best-effort, bounded by the
//!    broadcast ring) and otherwise issues a fresh snapshot.
//!
//! **Isolation (invariant #10) is the load-bearing property.** The reader pulls
//! from the broadcast with [`EventSubscription::recv`]; a slow client that falls
//! behind observes [`RecvError::Lagged`] and the reader **skips/resubscribes**
//! (lagged-skip) rather than ever applying back-pressure. The engine's publish
//! path is a non-blocking `broadcast::send`, so no client — slow, stalled, or
//! malicious — can stall the engine. The client-facing socket write is the only
//! thing that can block, and it blocks only this client's task, never the
//! engine.
