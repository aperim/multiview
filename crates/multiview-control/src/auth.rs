//! Authentication and authorization scaffolding (ADR-W005).
//!
//! Two concerns live here:
//!
//! * **Authentication.** Machine/API access uses a long, high-entropy random
//!   **API key** presented as a `Bearer` token. Keys are stored only as
//!   **HMAC-SHA256** digests (the brief: high-entropy keys do not need a slow
//!   KDF). [`ApiKeyStore::verify`] recomputes the HMAC over the presented key
//!   and compares in **constant time** ([`subtle`]) to defeat timing oracles.
//! * **Authorization.** A coarse [`Role`] (admin/operator/viewer) gates *what
//!   actions* a principal may take, and a per-object [`authorize_object`] check
//!   defends against **BOLA** (OWASP API1) — the broken-object-level-authz risk
//!   the brief flags as #1: role gating alone is not enough, every resource id
//!   must be checked against what the principal is allowed to touch.
//!
//! This is scaffolding: the cookie-session + CSRF path for the browser UI is
//! out of scope here; API-key + RBAC + per-object authz is the tested surface.
