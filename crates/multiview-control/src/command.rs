//! The engine **command bus** (ADR-W008): control's inbound channel to the
//! engine.
//!
//! Multiview's engine (`multiview-engine`) does not yet expose an inbound command
//! intake (hot-reconfiguration is a later milestone), so the command-bus
//! contract is defined here. It is the *one* direction in which the control
//! plane talks **to** the engine, and it is built so it can **never**
//! back-pressure the engine (invariant #10):
//!
//! * It is a **bounded** `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel. Control is the producer;
//!   the engine side holds the drainable [`CommandReceiver`].
//! * Control submits with [`CommandSender::try_submit`], which **never blocks
//!   or awaits**: when the queue is full it returns [`SubmitError::Full`]
//!   immediately (the HTTP layer maps that to `503` /
//!   [`ControlError::EngineBusy`](crate::error::ControlError::EngineBusy)). A
//!   slow or stopped engine drain therefore sheds control load rather than
//!   blocking control, and a flood of control commands can never grow memory
//!   without bound or stall the engine.
//! * The engine drains **at its leisure** with [`CommandReceiver::try_drain`]
//!   (non-blocking, e.g. once per tick) or [`CommandReceiver::recv`] (awaited on
//!   its own task) — its choice, never forced by control.
//!
//! Every submitted command carries an [`OperationId`]: long-running commands
//! return `202 Accepted` + that id immediately, and the engine reports the
//! eventual outcome on the realtime event stream correlated by the same id
//! (ADR-W008). The HTTP response never waits for the engine to apply the change.
