//! The Boot / Loaded / Running configuration model (ADR-W024).
//!
//! * **Boot** is the config file `multiview run` started with — the watched,
//!   hand-edited cold-start baseline.
//! * **Loaded** is the immutable snapshot of Boot taken at process start,
//!   held in memory ([`BootModel::loaded`]) and persisted to
//!   `<config-dir>/.multiview/loaded.toml` ([`persist_loaded`]).
//! * **Running** is Loaded + every live change since. It is continuously
//!   persisted — debounced, atomic-rename, machine-written, NEVER watched —
//!   to `<config-dir>/.multiview/active.toml`, composed via the SAME document
//!   composition `GET /api/v1/config/export` uses ([`persist_running_now`]).
//!   The trigger is the ONE audit choke point: every successful mutation
//!   passes [`crate::AppState::audit`], which fires the coalescing
//!   `running_changed` notify the [`spawn_running_persist`] task waits on.
//!
//! Cold start: `[control] start = "resume"` loads a valid `active.toml` as
//! the starting Running state ([`load_resume_config`]); invalid/missing falls
//! back to boot with a warning (the caller surfaces the reason). Loaded stays
//! the boot snapshot in both modes.
//!
//! Isolation (invariants #1/#10): everything here is control-plane tenancy on
//! tokio — composition reads read-mostly stores, persistence writes files,
//! and the notify is a one-permit coalescing signal that can never queue,
//! grow, or block. The render thread never sees any of it.
