//! Shutdown-aware, guard-owning transport wrapper for the control-plane serve loop
//! (SEC-14 #126 R2 / [ADR-W031](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-W031.md)).
//!
//! [`TrackedStream`] wraps an accepted connection stream (a `TcpStream`, or a
//! `TlsStream` **after** its handshake) so that:
//!
//! * it **owns** the accept-level
//!   [`ConnectionGuard`](crate::limits::ConnectionGuard), so the population-cap slot
//!   (global + per-IP) is held for the connection's *real* life — including after an
//!   HTTP/1 **Upgrade**. hyper moves the wrapped IO into its `Upgraded`, so the guard
//!   rides into the (detached) WebSocket task and releases only when that socket
//!   finally closes. Without this the guard would drop the instant `serve_connection`
//!   returns — which is at the upgrade handshake, not the WebSocket's end — so
//!   sequential WebSocket upgrades would silently bypass the per-IP population cap
//!   (the F1 escape).
//!
//! * it is **shutdown-aware**: once the serve loop's shutdown `watch` flips (or its
//!   sender drops), reads return EOF and writes fail. A live upgraded WebSocket is a
//!   detached task the drain [`JoinSet`](tokio::task::JoinSet) does not track, so it
//!   cannot be aborted at the ceiling; instead it observes the shutdown *through its
//!   own transport* and drains cooperatively (the [`run_ws_session`] loop selects on
//!   `socket.recv()`, which then returns end-of-stream). serve() does **not**
//!   synchronously await that detached task — the drain is prompt-and-cooperative, not
//!   awaited.
//!
//! The read and write halves each own an **independent** shutdown waiter (a `watch`
//! receiver clone + its own wait-future), so a **parked** read *and* a **parked** write
//! each wake the instant shutdown is signalled — regardless of which half was polled
//! last, and even if the two halves are ever driven from different tasks (an
//! `io::split`). Each waiter owns its receiver (moved in), so its registration persists
//! across polls (a fresh `changed()` per poll would deregister on drop and miss the
//! signal). A single shared waiter would let whichever half polled last overwrite the
//! other's waker slot and miss the flip — a lost wakeup on the drain path, which for the
//! inv#10 drain guarantee we make impossible by construction rather than rely on nothing
//! ever splitting the stream.
//!
