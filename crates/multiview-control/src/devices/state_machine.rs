//! The device runtime state machine (ADR-M008 §2.2).
//!
//! A managed device rides a typed lifecycle the future driver actors
//! (DEV-A4/A5) drive; this slice models the **state and transitions only** —
//! there is no real device I/O here. The states are the
//! [`multiview_events::DeviceState`] wire vocabulary so the control plane and
//! the realtime `device.status` event speak one enum:
//!
//! ```text
//! DISCOVERED ──adopt──▶ ADOPTING ──probe ok──▶ ONLINE ◀──recover── DEGRADED
//!                          │                     │  ▲                  ▲
//!                          │ bad creds           │  └─reconnect────────┘
//!                          ▼                     ▼
//!                     AUTH_FAILED           UNREACHABLE
//! ```
//!
//! `DISCOVERED` is the untrusted-inventory state (ADR-0041) and is never a
//! registry entry, so a registry device starts in `ADOPTING`. `AUTH_FAILED`
//! opens the supervised-reconnect breaker immediately: a bare reconnect attempt
//! does **nothing** while it is open; only a credential update re-arms a probe.
