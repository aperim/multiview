//! The Cast **session actor** (DEV-D2, ADR-M011): the supervised
//! control-plane task that owns one CASTV2 conversation with a Cast device
//! and drives the DEV-A3 [`DeviceLifecycle`] from it.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle (ADR-M011 / managed-devices §5.1)
//!
//! On spawn the actor **establishes**: connect (TLS via the seam) → virtual
//! `CONNECT` to the platform receiver → `LAUNCH` the Default Media Receiver
//! (`CC1AD845`) → `CONNECT` to the launched app's transport → `LOAD` the
//! device-reachable HLS rendition (`streamType: LIVE`, explicit
//! `hlsVideoSegmentFormat`). Established, it heartbeats: **PING every 10 s,
//! the session is dead after 20 s without inbound traffic** (a PONG is the
//! guaranteed generator; any inbound frame proves channel liveness), then
//! **reconnects on a 5 s cadence**. A reconnect with a previously
//! established session **asks first** (`GET_STATUS`): when our receiver
//! session survived the blip the actor re-`CONNECT`s to its transport and
//! resumes supervising — playback is untouched; only when the session is
//! gone with nothing else running does it re-`LAUNCH` + re-`LOAD`. A media
//! `IDLE` status, a rejected `LOAD` (`LOAD_FAILED` / `LOAD_CANCELLED` /
//! media-namespace `INVALID_REQUEST`), or a **vanished media session** (an
//! empty post-LOAD `MEDIA_STATUS`) **re-`LOAD`s after the reload delay**
//! (delayed so an instantly-failing rendition cannot drive a LOAD storm).
//!
//! Reconnects are **address-based**: the actor re-dials the authority it was
//! built with. Re-resolving a moved device by its mDNS UUID is the DEV-A5
//! discovery driver's job — no discovery infrastructure exists on this base
//! yet, so a DHCP-moved device rides UNREACHABLE until re-adopted at its new
//! address (documented limitation, not silent behaviour).
//!
//! ## Preemption is surfaced, never fought
//!
//! The CASTV2 protocol has no sender authentication: any LAN client can take
//! the device. Preemption is keyed on **session identity**, never the app
//! id: our receiver `sessionId` gone while another sender's app runs (a
//! foreign app, or a *new session of the same* Default Media Receiver — the
//! pychromecast/Home-Assistant pattern), or our `mediaSessionId` replaced by
//! an active foreign media session, marks the session preempted. The actor
//! publishes `device.error` ("preempted…"), drives `DEGRADED`, and stops
//! supervising the media — it never re-`LAUNCH`es over the other sender
//! (ADR-M011); later reconnects re-establish the management channel only.
//! Our app gone with **nothing** else running (at most the receiver's idle
//! screen) is *not* a preemption — the app idled out or crashed, and the
//! actor re-establishes (re-`LAUNCH` + re-`LOAD`). The operator resolves a
//! real preemption by stopping/restarting the session (or re-adopting the
//! device).
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #10)
//!
//! Pure control plane: the actor publishes through the [`DeviceBroadcaster`]
//! (drop-oldest broadcast + latest-wins registry) and never touches the
//! engine; its control channel is the same bounded non-blocking `mpsc` every
//! poller uses. A hung device can at worst stall its own task. The media
//! path is untouched — the device fetches an HLS rendition that is already
//! being served (encode-once preserved; invariant #1 trivially safe).
