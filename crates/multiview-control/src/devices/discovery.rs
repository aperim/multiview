//! mDNS/DNS-SD device **discovery** — new shared control-plane infrastructure
//! (ADR-M008 §6, ADR-0041 untrusted-inventory doctrine; DEV-A5).
//!
//! No working mDNS code existed in the repo before this module (the NMOS
//! transport is a compile-only seam). Discovery is built once here and shared by
//! the Cast / NDI / zowietek browses. Its output is an **untrusted inventory
//! requiring explicit confirm-adopt**: discovered services are *hints*, never
//! registry entries. Discovery NEVER creates a device — an operator confirms by
//! `POST`ing to the existing `/api/v1/devices/{id}` adopt referencing a
//! discovered address. This is the ADR-0041 doctrine applied to devices.
//!
//! ## What is browsed
//!
//! * `_googlecast._tcp.local.` — Cast targets. Cast **groups** advertise a
//!   non-8009 port, so the mDNS-advertised port is always used, never assumed.
//! * `_ndi._tcp.local.` — NDI sources. `ZowieBox` encoder-mode units advertise
//!   this (verified on hardware 2026-06-10).
//! * an **operator-configured** zowietek-control service type — the vendor's
//!   control-API mDNS service type is **undocumented / unverified** (the public
//!   doc mentions an mDNS section but gives no service-type string). We do **not**
//!   fabricate one: a zowietek-control browse type is recognised **only** when the
//!   operator configures it via the `[discovery]` config section
//!   (`multiview_config::DiscoveryConfig::zowietek_service_type`; best-effort,
//!   clearly labelled unverified). Until then, such a service is reported
//!   `unknown`, never mis-claimed as zowietek. The same section's
//!   `extra_service_types` adds further browse types (extra scope, never extra
//!   trust — they classify by the same honest inference).
//!
//! ## Trust + isolation (ADR-0041, invariant #10)
//!
//! The inventory is bounded (drop-oldest), TTL-expiring, and dedup-keyed. The
//! browse is a control-plane task that publishes `device.discovered` via the
//! conflating [`DeviceBroadcaster`](super::broadcaster::DeviceBroadcaster) into
//! the engine's **non-blocking drop-oldest** event broadcast and writes the
//! inventory behind a short-held `Mutex` the engine never touches. Nothing here
//! can back-pressure the engine — the same proof shape as the other
//! control-plane producers. The real multicast socket lives behind the
//! off-by-default `discovery` feature ([`MdnsBrowser`]); the model, the
//! driver-kind inference, the interleaved drain ([`drain_interleaved`]), and
//! the injected [`DiscoveryBrowser`] seam are always compiled and tested
//! socket-free.
//!
//! ## Hostile-responder bounds
//!
//! mDNS answers are unauthenticated LAN input. Everything a responder controls
//! is bounded before it is retained: one scan collects at most
//! [`MAX_SCAN_EVENTS`] services (fair-shared across the browsed types), and
//! every advertised string/list is truncated/capped by
//! [`DiscoveredService::from_raw`] ([`MAX_FIELD_LEN`], [`MAX_TXT_VALUE_LEN`],
//! [`MAX_TXT_RECORDS`], [`MAX_ENDPOINTS`]). Scans themselves are single-flight
//! ([`ScanGate`]) — bounded *and* rate-limited (ADR-M008).
