//! The conflating device broadcaster (ADR-RT007, invariant #10).
//!
//! Every device event originates here, in the **control plane** — never the
//! engine. The broadcaster is the single producer the future driver pollers
//! (DEV-A4/A5) call to publish into the engine's drop-oldest event broadcast
//! (`EnginePublisher::publish_event`, a non-blocking `broadcast::Sender::send`)
//! and to update the latest-wins [`DeviceStatusRegistry`].
//!
//! ## Isolation proof (invariant #10)
//!
//! The engine **never produces, forwards, or awaits** a device event — it only
//! owns the broadcast channel the control plane publishes into. Publishing is a
//! wait-free `send` that drops the oldest buffered event for a slow subscriber
//! and never blocks the producer; the status lane is conflated latest-wins in
//! the [`DeviceStatusRegistry`] (N devices × ~1 Hz polling never grows a queue),
//! and the lifecycle lane is bounded by the broadcast ring. So nothing on this
//! topic can back-pressure the engine, by construction — the same proof shape
//! as every other control-plane producer (alarms, tally).
//!
//! ## Conflation policy
//!
//! `device.status` (and `timing.status`) are conflated, latest-wins telemetry
//! **excluded from the lossless replay ring**; the device lifecycle events
//! (`device.adopted`/`.removed`/`.mode`/`.error`/`.sync`) and the cast-session
//! membership events (`cast.session.started`/`.removed`, DEV-D3.1) are
//! lossless. The
//! session pump applies `topic.is_high_rate() || event.is_conflated()` to
//! decide ring-exclusion per event type. This broadcaster's job is only to
//! *publish* those events with the correct types + the registry update; the
//! pump (in [`crate::realtime`]) enforces the ring rule on resume.
