//! The ingest pipeline: producer-agnostic wiring of decode -> normalize ->
//! jitter -> last-good-frame store.
//!
//! This module is **pure-Rust** and part of the default build. It owns the
//! ingest *core*: an [`IngestPump`] that takes any [`FrameProducer`] (a real
//! libav decoder behind the `ffmpeg` feature, or a synthetic producer in tests),
//! runs every produced frame through the [`PtsNormalizer`](crate::normalize)
//! (invariant #3) and an optional [`ReorderBuffer`](crate::jitter) jitter buffer,
//! and publishes the result into a [`TileStore`] — the lock-free last-good-frame
//! slot the compositor samples on each output tick (invariant #2).
//!
//! **Inputs are sampled, never pacing.** The pump only ever *writes* into the
//! store; it never blocks on a reader and never back-pressures the engine. A
//! bursting producer overwrites the single slot (newest wins) and a slow one is
//! held — bounded memory either way.
//!
//! ## Why a producer trait
//! The actual demux/decode lives behind the off-by-default `ffmpeg` feature and
//! is owned by `mosaic-ffmpeg` (the only crate allowed raw FFI). By depending on
//! a small [`FrameProducer`] trait here, the timing/resilience logic — the part
//! that must be exhaustively tested — stays pure-Rust and testable with a
//! synthetic producer, while the libav adapter (the `libav` module, behind the
//! `ffmpeg` feature) merely implements the trait.
