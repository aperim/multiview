//! TSL UMD protocol **decoders** (v3.1 / v4.0 / v5.0).
//!
//! The TSL UMD ("Under-Monitor Display") protocol family is the open de-facto
//! standard for carrying per-tile label text and tally lamps from an external
//! switcher / router / automation system into a multiviewer
//! (broadcast-multiviewer brief §2). This module hosts the **ingest** side: pure
//! byte-slice → typed [`UmdMessage`] decoders. The matching wire **encoders**
//! live in `mosaic-output`'s `tsl` module.
//!
//! These are **pure codecs**: byte-in, value-out, no I/O. The UDP/TCP/serial
//! sockets that carry them are a later integration (see the crate roadmap) — by
//! keeping the codecs socket-free they stay exhaustively property-testable with
//! golden on-wire vectors and round-trip identity tests, and they never touch the
//! engine hot path.
//!
//! ## The three protocol generations
//!
//! * [`v31`] — TSL UMD **v3.1**. A fixed **18-byte** packet (one display): an
//!   address byte (sync bit + 7-bit address), a control byte (two on/off tally
//!   bits + a 2-bit brightness), and a fixed **16-char ASCII** label. Carried one
//!   packet per serial frame or one packet per UDP datagram. No framing, no
//!   checksum.
//! * [`v40`] — TSL UMD **v4.0**. Extends v3.1 with a richer control byte giving
//!   **three** 4-state colour tallies (left / text / right; `0` = off, `1` = red,
//!   `2` = green, `3` = amber) plus 2-bit brightness, a per-display **checksum**,
//!   and a screen byte. Still a fixed 16-char ASCII label. On a TCP/byte-stream
//!   transport it is wrapped in **DLE/STX** framing.
//! * [`v50`] — TSL UMD **v5.0**. Native 16-bit IP protocol: a packet header with
//!   a 16-bit byte count and screen address, then one or more **variable-length**
//!   displays, each with a 16-bit index, a 16-bit control word (L / R / Text
//!   tally + brightness + a UTF-16LE text flag) and a length-prefixed
//!   **ASCII or UTF-16LE** label. Screen / index `0xFFFF` is the broadcast
//!   address. **DLE/STX byte-stuffing** is applied on TCP/byte-stream transports
//!   only (never on UDP).
//!
//! ## Tally mapping
//!
//! Wire tally colour codes map onto [`mosaic_core::tally::TallyColor`] and the
//! 2-bit brightness onto [`mosaic_core::tally::Brightness`] via the
//! [`TallyLamp`] helper, so the rest of Mosaic never sees raw wire codes.
