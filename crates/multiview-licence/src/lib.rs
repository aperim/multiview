//! # multiview-licence — the local entitlement / lease / ladder / fingerprint
//! data model (the Conspect **entitlement plane**, ADR-0050).
//!
//! This crate is the machine-side **entitlement** model: the signed
//! entitlement/lease resource ([`entitlement`], [`lease`]), the Ed25519
//! lease-verification path ([`verify`]), the enforcement ladder as **pure data**
//! ([`ladder`]), machine-identity **fingerprint scoring** ([`fingerprint`]), and
//! the published [`status::LicenceStatus`] hand-off shape.
//!
//! ## Never off air — this crate is physically incapable of touching output
//!
//! The single most important property of this crate (ADR-0050 §5/§6.3,
//! invariant #1): it **computes data and verifies signatures, and nothing
//! else.** It holds **no** `multiview-engine` dependency, **no** engine handle,
//! **no** process control, spawns **no** task, and performs **no** I/O. The
//! enforcement ladder is *data* — the hardest rung it can compute merely *asks*
//! the engine (via two booleans the cli derives and the engine reads off the hot
//! loop) to lock reconfiguration or stamp a corner watermark. There is no code
//! path here that can stop, stall, or de-pace a running program. Every computed
//! state answers `program_stays_on_air() == true` by construction
//! ([`ladder::LadderState::program_stays_on_air`]). A broadcaster's program is
//! sacred; this crate cannot violate that even by mistake.
//!
//! ## Scope of THIS crate (CONSPECT-0 + the data-model half of CONSPECT-1)
//!
//! Pure data + verification only. There are **no** licence-server calls (the
//! `heartbeat` network client is a later, feature-gated item) and **no** engine
//! seams wired here (those are CONSPECT-2/CONSPECT-10). The pinned verifying key
//! is a **parameter** ([`verify::PinnedKey`]); key pinning/rotation policy (O2)
//! lives in the caller.
//!
//! ## Data minimisation
//!
//! Machine identity is a **score over salted digests** ([`fingerprint`]) — this
//! crate is handed opaque digests and never gathers raw serials/MACs (brief §8).
//! It also never generates cryptographic keys: [`verify`] is verification-only,
//! so no RNG/entropy source enters the non-test build.
//!
//! The library target is `multiview_licence`.
