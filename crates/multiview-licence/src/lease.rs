//! The heartbeat-granted entitlement **lease** (ADR-0050 §4, brief §2.2, §6.1,
//! §12).
//!
//! A lease is the dated grant a successful heartbeat produces. It is pure data:
//! all of its bounds are computed from the grant instant and the exact day
//! constants ([`crate::constants`]) using `chrono::Duration` — **never float**
//! (CLAUDE.md safety rule #6). The lease arithmetic is the input to the
//! enforcement ladder ([`crate::ladder`]); this module only *holds* and *derives*
//! the dated bounds, it does not enforce anything.
