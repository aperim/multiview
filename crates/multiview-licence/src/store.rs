//! The local lease **store + install service** (CONSPECT-1, brief §1 of the
//! CONSPECT-1 scope).
//!
//! The store holds the current verified active [`Entitlement`] and, on read,
//! computes the enforcement ladder via [`compute_ladder_state`] at an injected
//! instant. It is the machine-side source of truth for "what is this machine
//! entitled to". It is **thread-safe, in-memory, best-effort, and never reads a
//! system clock itself** — the clock is a [`Clock`] seam the caller (the cli)
//! supplies, so the store stays deterministic and testable (data minimisation +
//! the never-off-air invariant: it holds data and computes, nothing else).
//!
//! # Never off air (invariant #1 / #10)
//!
//! The store holds an `RwLock` over control-plane-only state. It has **no**
//! engine handle, spawns **no** task on the data plane, and is read off the hot
//! loop (the engine only ever samples the two derived booleans the cli lifts out
//! of the computed status). A wedged reader of this store cannot back-pressure
//! the engine. Installation **fails toward leniency**: an install that cannot be
//! verified is rejected and the previously-installed (or empty) state stays in
//! place — the store never installs a worse state on a transient fault.
//!
//! # The three install paths converge here
//!
//! Filesystem-drop ([`crate::watcher`]), `POST /api/v1/licence/lease`, and the
//! web-UI upload all land on [`LeaseStore::install_binding`]: verify the
//! `Ed25519` signature against the pinned key, check the fingerprint score is at/above the
//! threshold, reject a stale (older) grant, then install. One code path, one set
//! of typed rejections.
