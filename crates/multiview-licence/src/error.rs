//! The crate error taxonomy (per-crate `Error` enum via `thiserror`,
//! conventions §9).
//!
//! Every fallible operation in this crate returns one of these — there is no
//! `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic` in non-test code (CLAUDE.md guardrail #1). Note
//! that **none** of these variants can stop output: this crate computes data
//! and verifies signatures; it has no engine handle and no process control
//! (the never-off-air invariant, ADR-0050 §5).

/// Errors raised by the entitlement plane's pure-data + verification surface.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, thiserror::Error)]
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum LicenceError {
    /// The supplied verifying key was not a well-formed Ed25519 public key
    /// (wrong length or invalid point encoding).
    #[error("malformed Ed25519 verifying key")]
    MalformedKey,

    /// The signature bytes were not a well-formed Ed25519 signature (wrong
    /// length). Distinct from [`LicenceError::BadSignature`] so a transport
    /// framing bug is not confused with a genuine verification failure.

    MalformedSignature,

    /// The signature did not verify against the pinned public key — a tampered
    /// payload, the wrong signer, or a forged assertion. The lease is rejected.
