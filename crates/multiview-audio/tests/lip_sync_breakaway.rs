// RT-8a held-out lip-sync test (the one that matters per the refuted CLAIM 5).
//
// The program bus must keep audio lip-synced to the output tick index even when
// video frames are dropped (DropOnOverload) and a mid-stream audio breakaway
// (`repoint`) swaps which warm store the program bus reads. Two properties are
// asserted:
//
//   (a) NO DRIFT: cumulative emitted samples after driving the bus to absolute
//       tick index T equals the SampleClock ideal `floor(T * rate * den / num)`,
//       regardless of how many ticks were SKIPPED in between (the catch-up that
//       inv #3 demands under DropOnOverload). A surviving-frame-paced `tick()`
//       would trail by exactly the dropped ticks' samples — this test forbids
//       that.
//
//   (b) SAMPLE-ALIGNED SEAM: a mid-stream `repoint` onto a warm store that has
//       been buffering (base far ahead, drop-oldest) must read from the LIVE
//       EDGE at the seam — no silence gap, no climb-from-zero through evicted
//       history. The first post-repoint block carries the new source's live
//       audio, not silence.
