//! The mix/route model: a program bus plus discrete per-input tracks, with a
//! per-input gain/route matrix (ADR-R005).
//!
//! This is the pure-Rust *model* of audio routing — it operates on in-memory
//! [`AudioBlock`]s. The libav decode/resample that fills those blocks lives
//! behind the off-by-default `ffmpeg` feature and is not part of this layer.
//!
//! Routing rules (per the ADR):
//! - Each input fans out to (a) a clean **discrete track** carried unaltered
//!   and (b) the mixed **program bus** scaled by the input's program route
//!   gain.
//! - An input with no fresh block this tick contributes **silence** to the bus
//!   (gap-free; the mixer never stalls waiting for an input).
//! - The program bus is hard-limited to the `[-1.0, 1.0]` sample domain so it
//!   never overflows.
