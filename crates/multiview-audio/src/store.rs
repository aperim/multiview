//! The bounded **last-good audio store** — the audio peer of the video tile
//! store ([`multiview_framestore::TileStore`]).
//!
//! A decode thread (one per source) publishes decoded+resampled
//! [`AudioBlock`]s into an [`AudioStore`]; the output clock *samples* the store
//! per tick, pulling exactly the number of frames it needs. Audio is therefore
//! **sampled, never pacing** — exactly like the video tiles (invariant #1) — and
//! the store **never back-pressures the engine** (invariant #10): the reader is
//! wait-free and a publish never blocks waiting on a reader.
//!
//! ## Gap-free by construction (ADR-R005 §4.1)
//! Unlike video, audio is a *continuous* stream: the engine pulls a contiguous
//! run of samples each tick, so a dropout must read **silence**, never a short
//! or absent block (a gap would click/desync). [`AudioStore::read`] therefore
//! always returns exactly the requested number of frames, silence-filling any
//! region that has not been written (past EOF / before the first block) or has
//! already been evicted from the bounded ring. This is the audio analogue of
//! `anullsrc` silence-fill, load-bearing for resilience invariant A
//! (resilience-and-av §4.1).
//!
//! ## Bounded — drop-oldest, never grows
//! The ring holds at most `capacity_frames` frames of interleaved PCM. A
//! producer that runs ahead of a slow reader drops the **oldest** samples beyond
//! capacity rather than growing — the data-plane "queues drop, never grow" rule.
//! A reader that has fallen behind the surviving window reads silence for the
//! evicted span and then catches the live tail.
//!
//! ## Lock-free
//! The sample window lives behind an [`arc_swap::ArcSwap`] snapshot — the same
//! primitive the video tile store uses. The reader loads an immutable snapshot
//! wait-free; the writer builds the next snapshot and swaps it in. There is no
//! `unsafe` (this crate is `unsafe_code = forbid`) and no mutex on the read path.
//!
//! The read cursor is a single [`AtomicI64`]: the store is a single-producer /
//! single-consumer handoff (one decode thread, one output clock), and only the
//! consumer advances the cursor, so it is never torn.
