//! The per-tile last-good-frame store: lock-free slot + failure-ladder state.
//!
//! [`TileStore<T>`] ties together the lock-free [`LatestSlot`] (the
//! last-good-frame cell) and the [`classify`] failure-ladder policy. It is the
//! concrete realization of invariant #2 for a single tile:
//!
//! * **Writers** (a decoder) call [`TileStore::publish`] with the frame and the
//!   timeline instant it arrived. This is non-blocking and newest-wins.
//! * **Readers** (the compositor, on each output tick) call [`TileStore::read`]
//!   with the current instant. They never block and always get a definite
//!   answer: a fresh frame, the *held* last-good frame, or an explicit
//!   `NoSignal` indicator — never a stall.
//!
//! Time is **injected**: every method that needs "now" takes a [`MediaTime`],
//! so the whole state ladder is deterministically testable with no real clock
//! and no sleeps.
