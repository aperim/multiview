//! A lock-free single-slot "latest value" store.
//!
//! [`LatestSlot<T>`] is the primitive behind invariant #2's per-tile
//! last-good-frame store (see [`crate::tile`]). It holds at most one value with
//! an **overwrite / newest-wins** policy: a writer publishes the latest value
//! and an older pending value is dropped; a reader always observes the most
//! recently published value (or nothing) and **never blocks**.
//!
//! It is implemented on top of [`arc_swap::ArcSwapOption`] — a safe, well-tested
//! lock-free atomic `Arc` slot — rather than any hand-rolled `unsafe`. Reads
//! return a fresh [`Arc<T>`] clone, so the value cannot be torn or freed out
//! from under a reader: an in-flight reader keeps its `Arc` alive even as a new
//! value is published over the top.
//!
//! The slot is the textbook SPSC handoff (one decoder writes, one compositor
//! reads), but `ArcSwapOption` is fully thread-safe, so concurrent writers and
//! readers are also sound — they simply race to publish/observe, exactly the
//! semantics a live mosaic wants.
