//! Caption-presence probe: a pure timeout state machine over the subtitle path.
//!
//! The probe watches caption/subtitle activity and raises a **caption-loss**
//! alarm ([`mosaic_core::alarm::AlarmKind::CaptionLoss`]) when no caption is seen
//! within a configured timeout, clearing again when activity resumes. Like the
//! [`crate::alert`] card it is driven **only** by an injected media clock and by
//! explicit `observe_caption` calls — never by a live decode — so it cannot
//! back-pressure or stall the engine (invariant #10) and is exactly testable.
//!
//! Presence is reported as text ([`CaptionPresence::label`]) so the on-tile
//! badge conveys state without relying on colour (accessibility). The severity
//! is reported on the shared [`mosaic_core::alarm::PerceivedSeverity`] scale so
//! the engine's roll-up can fold it in.
