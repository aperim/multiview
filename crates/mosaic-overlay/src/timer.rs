//! Count-up / count-down / down-then-up timers and round-robin page cycling
//! (broadcast brief §5).
//!
//! Timers and the round-robin cycler are **pure value-machines over an injected
//! [`MediaTime`]** (the engine's media clock) — exactly like
//! [`crate::alert::AlertCard`] and `mosaic-framestore`'s state machine. They
//! never read a wall clock, never spawn, and never touch the engine tick loop:
//! the renderer (or control surface) calls [`Timer::display`] / [`Timer::phase`]
//! / [`RoundRobin::page_at`] with the current media time and gets back a value.
//!
//! All arithmetic is integer nanoseconds (invariant #3); the displayed
//! `HH:MM:SS` is whole-second truncation. A count-down clamps at zero (never
//! negative); a down-then-up timer counts the overrun upward past the deadline.
//!
//! **Accessibility:** the warning/expiry state is exposed as a
//! [`TimerPhase`] the renderer reads as text/state — the "wrap colour" of a
//! broadcast timer is a *consequence* of the phase, never the only signal.
