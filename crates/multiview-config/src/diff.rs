//! The pure per-section structural diff between two configuration documents
//! (ADR-W020).
//!
//! [`ConfigDiff::between`] compares a **running** (currently-applied) document
//! against a **next** (just-loaded) one and reports, per section, exactly what
//! changed — the unit the config-file watcher turns into apply actions: source
//! changes ride the live `UpsertSource`/`RemoveSource` machinery, a
//! layout/cells change rides the apply-layout path, a pinned-canvas change is
//! Class-2 (restart), and every other changed section is named for the
//! reseed + requires-restart surface.
//!
//! Pure and total: no I/O, no clocks, no allocation beyond the reported
//! changes. Comparison is over the typed schema (`PartialEq`), so semantic
//! equality holds where the schema defines it — e.g. an [`Fps`] cadence
//! compares **by value** (`50/2 == 25/1`), never by spelling.
