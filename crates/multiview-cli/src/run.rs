//! The `multiview run` subcommand and its **FFmpeg-free software engine**.
//!
//! [`SoftwareEngine`] wires the protected output core from a validated
//! [`MultiviewConfig`]:
//!
//! * a fixed-cadence [`OutputClock`] at the canvas cadence (exact rational);
//! * one [`TileStore<Nv12Image>`] per declared source, holding the source's
//!   synthetic frame — real colour bars / solid for the `bars`/`solid` kinds, a
//!   per-tile placeholder for kinds that need a decoder this build lacks;
//! * a CPU reference [`CompositorDrive`] over the solved
//!   [`multiview_core::layout::Layout`]; and
//! * the engine's outbound [`EnginePublisher`] (invariant #10 isolation).
//!
//! It then drives exactly one composited frame per tick for a bounded number of
//! ticks (or until Ctrl-C in the binary), and reports the outcome. This is a
//! GPU-free, `FFmpeg`-free **software end-to-end smoke of invariant #1**: the
//! output emits one valid frame per tick, on cadence, forever, independent of
//! input health.
//!
//! The driver is the engine's own [`EngineRuntime`], parameterized by an
//! injected [`TimeSource`] + [`Pacer`] so the same code runs deterministically
//! in tests (manual time + cooperative pacer, no real sleeps) and in production
//! (monotonic time + realtime pacer).
