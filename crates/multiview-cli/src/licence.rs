//! The Conspect **entitlement-plane wiring** for the cli (CONSPECT-2b/10,
//! ADR-0050 §3/§5/§7, the brief §13.6).
//!
//! The cli owns the single shared entitlement [`LeaseStore`] and threads its
//! computed state into the engine seams as **data**:
//!
//! * **S1 (startup gate):** the sampled [`EnforcementLevel`] the
//!   [`SoftwareEngine::build_gated`](crate::run::SoftwareEngine::build_gated)
//!   consults *before* building a NEW engine — see [`current_level`].
//! * **S3 (tile watermark):** the wait-free [`WatermarkSignal`] the overlay bake
//!   samples each frame to decide whether to stamp the corner watermark.
//! * The same store backs the control plane's `LicenceState`, so the API, the
//!   chrome, and the engine all read the **same** ladder state — there is no
//!   second opinion (ADR-0050 §2).
//!
//! # Never off air (invariant #1 / #10)
//!
//! Everything here is **data the engine samples**, never control flow on the tick
//! path. The [`WatermarkSignal`] is an `arc_swap`'d [`EnforcementLevel`] read with
//! a single wait-free load — no lock, no allocation, no `.await` — so the overlay
//! bake's per-frame watermark decision cannot pace or stall the output clock. The
//! signal is updated **off-thread** (a background poll of the lease store), never
//! from the hot loop. The startup gate runs only at build time; a running engine
//! is never re-gated (ADR-0050 §6.3).
