//!
//! ## Ingest is streamed, never buffered (BUG-2 fix)
//!
//! Each declared source decodes on its **own dedicated thread** and publishes
//! frames into its per-tile [`TileStore`](multiview_framestore::TileStore) as they
//! arrive — the output clock starts immediately and **samples** the stores per
//! tick. A live stream (RTSP/HLS/SRT/RTMP/TS) never emits EOF, so the previous
//! "decode the whole source into a `Vec` before starting the clock" approach
//! hung forever and never honoured `--duration`/`--ticks`. Streaming makes a
//! live input a *sampled* producer that can neither pace nor stall the output
//! clock (invariant #1), and a bounded run (`run_for`) stops the clock after `N`
//! ticks and tears the ingest threads down (they cannot back-pressure the
//! engine — invariant #10).
//!
//! Per [invariant #4](../docs/research/streaming-gotchas.md) the ingest threads
//! pace each frame to wall-clock **by its PTS** (a custom pacer; `-re` is never
//! used) so a live source plays in real time and a file/VOD source plays at its
//! natural rate rather than being slurped as fast as the disk allows.
//!
//! ## Invariants upheld
//!
//! * **#1 output-clock.** The engine's [`EngineRuntime`](multiview_engine::EngineRuntime)
//!   emits exactly one composited frame per tick; a source that has produced no
//!   frame yet, or has run out of frames, simply holds its last-good frame (or
//!   shows the slate) — it never stalls the loop. Ingest runs on separate
//!   threads the engine never waits on.
//! * **#3 timing.** PTS is re-stamped from the tick counter by the output sinks
//!   (`out_pts = tick`); raw input PTS is never forwarded to an encoder/muxer.
//! * **#5 NV12-throughout.** Frames stay NV12 from decode through composite; the
//!   one NV12 → encoder-format (`yuv420p`) conversion happens inside the sink,
//!   immediately before `send_frame`.
//! * **#7 encode-once-mux-many.** The canvas is composited once per tick and
//!   encoded once per rendition; the file and HLS sinks each consume the *same*
//!   composited frames.
//! * **Licensing.** The default encode codec is LGPL `mpeg2video`; the GPL
//!   `libx264` path is reachable only when the crate is built with
//!   `gpl-codecs`. No FFI lives here — the crate stays `unsafe_code = forbid`.
