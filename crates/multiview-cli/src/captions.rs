//! Native in-pipeline **HLS WebVTT caption ingest** (features `ffmpeg` +
//! `overlay`).
//!
//! libav opens an HLS URL as a single program (the chosen video variant); it does
//! **not** surface the master playlist's separate `TYPE=SUBTITLES` rendition as a
//! decodable stream. So when a source's [`CaptionSelector`] resolves to an
//! HLS/`WebVTT` subtitle rendition, this module:
//!
//! 1. fetches the **master** playlist text (the source URL) via libav's I/O,
//! 2. parses it with [`multiview_input::hls::MasterPlaylist`],
//! 3. [`picks`](multiview_input::hls::MasterPlaylist::pick_subtitle) the subtitle
//!    rendition for the requested language (or the default),
//! 4. resolves the rendition's (usually relative) `URI` against the master's base
//!    directory ([`resolve_rendition_uri`]), and
//! 5. spawns a **second isolated demux** of that rendition `m3u8` on its own
//!    ingest thread that decodes each `WebVTT` cue with
//!    [`multiview_ffmpeg::CaptionDecoder`] and publishes it into a per-source
//!    [`CaptionCueStore`].
//!
//! The reader is **best-effort**: any fetch/parse/decode error logs and yields no
//! cues (the tile simply shows none). It only ever *writes* the lock-free cue
//! store — it can neither pace nor stall the output clock (invariant #1) nor
//! back-pressure the engine (invariant #10), exactly like the video ingest
//! threads. The off-hot-path overlay baker *samples* the store at each output
//! tick (`active_at(pts)`), mirroring frame-store latch-on-tick.
//!
//! ## Timing (invariant #3)
//!
//! libav applies the rendition's `X-TIMESTAMP-MAP` itself, so the `WebVTT`
//! packets arrive already rebased onto a 0-based media timeline (the first cue's
//! packet PTS is `1.0s`, matching the bipbop video's source-relative timeline).
//! The reader anchors each cue's window with [`multiview_ffmpeg::CaptionDecoder`]
//! (packet PTS rebased to ns through the stream time-base) and publishes it on
//! the same source-relative timeline the video frames use, so a cue burns in at
//! the same media instant the output clock samples it.
