//! Lookup-table evaluation of the per-pixel transfer functions (ADR-0022).
//!
//! The CPU reference compositor's hot loop runs the transcendental EOTF/OETF
//! ([`transfer::eotf`]/[`transfer::oetf`]) three times per channel per covering
//! tile per pixel — each a `pow`/`ln`/`exp`. At 1080p × N tiles that dominates
//! the per-tick cost. This module replaces the *evaluation* of those two
//! functions with sampled tables + linear interpolation, **without changing the
//! fixed pipeline order (invariant #8)**: the front half still runs
//! range-expand → YUV→RGB matrix → EOTF → primaries-convert, and the back half
//! still runs OETF → RGB→YUV → range-compress; only the EOTF/OETF nodes are
//! looked up instead of computed.
//!
//! The un-LUT'd [`transfer`] module remains the **golden oracle**: each table is
//! built by sampling it, the equivalence is gated by `tests/lut_vs_reference.rs`
//! (front half within `2e-3` linear, frame bytes within `±1`), and any transfer
//! the oracle does not support still routes through the oracle dispatch so it
//! returns the *same* [`Error::UnsupportedTransfer`] (the LUT never panics on an
//! out-of-domain key or an unsupported axis).
//!
//! ## EOTF table — keyed on the post-matrix gamma `f32`
//!
//! The EOTF input at the pipeline's step 3 is `rgb_gamma[i]`, a **continuous**
//! gamma-encoded value (not an 8-bit sample): for saturated chroma the YUV→RGB
//! matrix overshoots, so the input can land roughly in `[-0.5, 1.5]`. The table
//! covers exactly that domain with [`EOTF_NODES`] nodes and linearly
//! interpolates between the two bracketing nodes. Out-of-domain keys saturate to
//! the nearest endpoint (never panic). Sign for negative inputs is preserved
//! automatically because the oracle (`bt709_eotf` via `signed_pow`) is sampled
//! at the negative nodes directly.
//!
//! ## OETF table — linear `f32` → gamma `f32` over `[0, 1]`
//!
//! The encode-side OETF maps a linear-light channel in `[0, 1]` to a gamma code
//! value; the table has [`OETF_NODES`] nodes with linear interpolation. The
//! range-compression that follows ([`range::compress_luma`]/`compress_chroma`)
//! is **not** folded in — RGB→YUV + range-compress stay exactly as the oracle
//! runs them.
