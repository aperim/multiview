//! Error taxonomy for the compositor crate.
//!
//! The compositor exposes a single [`enum@Error`] enum (per-crate `thiserror`); it
//! converts into the workspace-wide [`mosaic_core::Error`] at the crate
//! boundary via [`From`], so callers can propagate compositor failures with
//! `?` into the shared taxonomy.
