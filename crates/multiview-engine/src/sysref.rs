//! System-clock **discipline reference** — the pure source-selection +
//! lock-classification logic that feeds the on-screen wall-clock reference badge.
//!
//! The wall-clock overlay shows the operator *which* timing reference disciplines
//! the displayed time-of-day and *how well* it is locked (a text + glyph badge,
//! never colour alone). Two discipline sources are detected and arbitrated here:
//!
//! * **System NTP/chrony** (`SYS`): the kernel's own clock-discipline state,
//!   read on Linux with `adjtimex`/`ntp_adjtime` (the `STA_*` status bits, the
//!   `TIME_*` clock state, and the estimated error). That syscall read lives
//!   behind the off-by-default [`live`] module / `ntp` feature (it needs a real,
//!   NTP-synchronised host to mean anything); the **classification** of a reading
//!   is pure and lives here, tested over injected snapshots.
//! * **PTP / ST 2059-2** (`PTP`): the disciplined-reference lock state produced
//!   by the [`ReferenceTracker`](crate::ptp::ReferenceTracker) (work item ENG-5),
//!   surfaced as a [`ReferenceStatus`].
//!
//! [`ReferenceSelector`] arbitrates the two into one authoritative
//! [`SelectedReference`] for the badge: PTP is the higher-stratum media reference
//! and wins whenever it is disciplined; otherwise the system NTP discipline is
//! reported.
//!
//! ## Invariant #1: this informs the badge only — it never paces the output clock
//!
//! Like the PTP servo, this whole module is a **pure value machine** over injected
//! readings. It owns no clock, performs no I/O in the default build, exposes no
//! method the output clock ([`OutputClock`](crate::clock::OutputClock)) calls, and
//! holds no reference to it. A clock that is `Freerun`, `Holdover`, or whose
//! `adjtimex` read fails on every sample changes only the displayed badge; it can
//! neither stall nor speed up the fixed-cadence `out_pts = f(tick)` tick loop. The
//! `sysref_no_pacing` test pins this behaviourally.
//!
//! All thresholds are **integer nanoseconds** (never float seconds — invariant
//! #3).
