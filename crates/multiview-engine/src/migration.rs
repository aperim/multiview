//! The **make-before-break (MBB) migration primitive** + the live
//! placement-execution loop (ADR-R010 + ADR-0018 §4 / GPU-5c).
//!
//! [`crate::placement::PlacementController`] is the pure brain: it *observes* a
//! wait-free [`DeviceLoad`] snapshot and *proposes* a
//! [`PlacementProposal`](crate::PlacementProposal) (`Hold`/`Shed`/`Migrate`/`Split`).
//! This module is the **execution** half GPU-5c wires: it reads those proposals
//! on a slow control tick (never the output clock) and *executes* an accepted
//! migration/split as the five-phase make-before-break lifecycle ADR-R010 pins —
//! VALIDATE → SPIN-UP → WARM (keepalive) → SWAP (the RT-12 `output ← program`
//! crosspoint) → DRAIN+STOP — and records the outcome in the
//! [`PlacementCounters`](multiview_telemetry::PlacementCounters).
//!
//! ## The RT-12 crosspoint ([`OutputCrosspoint`])
//!
//! ADR-R010 names *one* genuinely-new piece of engine infrastructure: the
//! cross-`Program` sink-cutover bridge over
//! [`multiview_output::fanout::PacketRouter::move_sink`] (which exists in
//! `multiview-output` but had **zero** engine callers). [`OutputCrosspoint`] is
//! that bridge: **one** shared [`PacketRouter`] in which each program is a
//! distinct [`RenditionId`], and a SWAP re-keys a consumer's
//! [`Arc<dyn PacketSink>`](multiview_output::fanout::PacketSink) from OLD's
//! rendition to NEW's. It is a frame-boundary table re-key — non-blocking,
//! non-erroring — guarded by a [`std::sync::Mutex`] across which **no `.await`
//! is ever held**: the coordinator's ops are all O(1) table mutations, and the
//! per-program egress `route()` runs on a dedicated egress thread (never the
//! pacer-gated clock loop, which only `try_send`s a tick index — see
//! [`crate::programset`]). So neither the lock nor `move_sink` can stall the
//! output clock (invariants #1 + #10).
//!
//! ## Zero-new-encode at SWAP — the keepalive ([`KeepaliveSink`])
//!
//! Encode-once-mux-many (inv #7) means a rendition with ≥1 sink is encoded once
//! per tick and a rendition with **no** sink is **cold** (not encoded). If the
//! SWAP moved a consumer onto a *cold* NEW rendition, the move itself would
//! trigger NEW's **first** encode at the cutover instant. The WARM phase
//! pre-attaches a discard [`KeepaliveSink`] to NEW's rendition so it is *already
//! encoding* before the cut — the load-bearing precondition for the
//! zero-new-encode guarantee (ADR-R010 §2.3/§2.4). The keepalive is dropped only
//! **after** the real consumer has moved onto NEW, so NEW never momentarily goes
//! cold mid-SWAP.
