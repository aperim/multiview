//! The **`ProgramSet`** supervisor + N independent output clocks (ADR-0030 §2,
//! MP-1).
//!
//! MP-0 introduced [`MultiviewProgram`](crate::MultiviewProgram): one program's
//! own [`OutputClock`](crate::OutputClock), [`CompositorDrive`](crate::CompositorDrive),
//! and [`StopSignal`](crate::StopSignal), driving the protected per-tick loop. The
//! CLI run path drove **one** such program. MP-1 adds the **supervisor** so **N**
//! programs run concurrently, each on its **own** independent clock.
//!
//! ## The shape (ADR-0030 §2.1 / §2.2)
//!
//! * **One shared time *source*, N independent output *clocks*.** Every program
//!   reads the **same** read-only [`Arc<dyn TimeSource>`](crate::TimeSource) for a
//!   common monotonic reference, but each owns its **own**
//!   [`OutputClock`](crate::OutputClock) + [`EngineRuntime`](crate::EngineRuntime)
//!   at its own cadence and seed. A 25 fps program and a 60 fps program advance on
//!   their own tick counters off the one shared reference — a master tick cannot
//!   serve both without resampling one (violating invariant #3). **There is no
//!   master clock**; the only shared thing is the read-only reference. This makes
//!   invariant #1's "one program stalling never stalls another" **structural**:
//!   each runtime awaits only its own pacer deadline (`runtime.rs` `run_inner`).
//! * **`Program` is the supervised actor.** Each [`Program`] runs on its **own**
//!   `tokio` task and implements [`Actor`](crate::Actor), so the existing
//!   [`Supervisor`](crate::Supervisor) + [`RestartPolicy`](crate::RestartPolicy)
//!   restart a *crashed* program with capped backoff while every **other** program
//!   keeps emitting. Failure is contained to one task.
//! * **`ProgramSet` is the supervisor/coordinator** — the only thing that knows
//!   there are many. It owns the shared `Arc<dyn TimeSource>`, the
//!   [`RestartPolicy`](crate::RestartPolicy), and the `ProgramId → ProgramHandle`
//!   map. [`ProgramSet::start`] admits + spawns **without touching** other
//!   programs; [`ProgramSet::stop`] raises **only** that program's
//!   [`StopSignal`](crate::StopSignal), drains its egress, and joins. No other
//!   program's clock is touched.
//!
//! ## Per-program egress + isolation (invariant #10, per program)
//!
//! Each [`Program`] owns its own **bounded drop-oldest egress**: the per-tick
//! projection pushes the tick index onto a fixed-capacity channel consumed by a
//! **dedicated egress thread**. A wedged/slow egress consumer fills the bounded
//! queue; the push is `try_send` + drop-and-count, so the program's **own** tick
//! loop never blocks on its egress (invariant #1), and — because each program's
//! egress is its own task — a wedge on one program **cannot** back-pressure
//! another's tick loop (invariant #10). The MP-1 chaos gate proves exactly this:
//! wedge one program's egress, assert a sibling's `ticks_emitted` keeps advancing.
//!
//! The supervisor never `.await`s a program task on the data plane: it samples
//! each program's wait-free `ticks_emitted` counter (a single Acquire load) and
//! only joins a task on an explicit [`ProgramSet::stop`] / [`ProgramSet::shutdown`].
