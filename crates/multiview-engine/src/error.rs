//! The per-crate error taxonomy for `multiview-engine`.
//!
//! Engine-level failures are configuration/startup errors (a bad cadence, an
//! invalid layout, a malformed control-loop budget) — the **hot path itself
//! never returns an error to a caller**: per invariants #1 and #2 the output
//! clock and the drive loop hold the last-good frame (or a `NoSignal` card) and
//! keep ticking rather than propagating a failure outward. These variants
//! therefore describe the *setup* seams, where a `Result` is the right contract.
