//! The integrated engine **runtime driver loop** (invariant #1, with #10).
//!
//! [`EngineRuntime`] is the one component that *owns the tick loop*. Given the
//! fixed-cadence [`OutputClock`], the [`CompositorDrive`], the outbound
//! [`EnginePublisher`] (invariant #10 isolation), and an injected
//! [`TimeSource`], it does — forever, until stopped — exactly this per tick:
//!
//! 1. **Pace to wall-clock.** Compute the absolute deadline of the next tick
//!    (`seed + pts_at(index)`; derived from the integer tick counter, never
//!    accumulated) and wait until the [`TimeSource`] reaches it via the injected
//!    [`Pacer`]. Because deadlines are absolute, OS sleep jitter cannot cause
//!    cumulative drift (ADR-T001).
//! 2. **Advance the clock.** [`OutputClock::tick`] yields the next [`Tick`] with
//!    its exact `out_pts = f(tick)`.
//! 3. **Sample + compose one frame.** [`CompositorDrive::compose`] reads each
//!    tile's last-good frame (or `NoSignal` slate) *without blocking* and
//!    produces exactly one valid composited frame for the tick.
//! 4. **Publish outward.** The composited frame's state snapshot goes to the
//!    wait-free latest-state slot, and a per-tick event to the drop-oldest
//!    broadcast. Both publish paths are physically incapable of being blocked by
//!    a consumer (invariant #10).
//!
//! The loop **never `.await`s an input or a consumer**: inputs are sampled from
//! lock-free stores, and publishing is non-blocking. The only thing it awaits is
//! the *pacer* (the wall-clock deadline) — which depends on nothing but the tick
//! counter and the injected time source. That is precisely what makes the output
//! "one frame per tick, on schedule, forever, independent of inputs and clients."
//!
//! ## Pacing seam
//!
//! Pacing is injected via the [`Pacer`] trait so the same loop runs two ways:
//!
//! * Production wires [`RealtimePacer`] over a [`MonotonicTimeSource`](crate::clock::MonotonicTimeSource): the wait
//!   becomes a real [`tokio::time::sleep`] until the deadline.
//! * Tests wire [`CooperativePacer`] over a [`ManualTimeSource`](crate::clock::ManualTimeSource): the wait
//!   becomes a cooperative [`tokio::task::yield_now`] spin until the (manually
//!   advanced) source reaches the deadline — **no real sleeps, fully
//!   deterministic**.
