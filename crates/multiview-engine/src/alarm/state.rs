//! The ITU-T X.733 alarm **state machine**: dwell-up / dwell-down hysteresis,
//! latch and operator acknowledge, as a pure function of an injected
//! [`MediaTime`] (ADR-MV001 / broadcast-multiviewer §4).
//!
//! A probe reports an instantaneous *condition present / absent* sample each tick
//! (see [`crate::probe`]); this machine decides when that condition has persisted
//! long enough to **raise** an alarm and when its absence has persisted long
//! enough to **clear** one. Two independent dwells give the hysteresis that stops
//! a flapping source from flapping the alarm:
//!
//! ```text
//!  Clear ──present──▶ Pending ──(held ≥ dwell_up)──▶ Raised
//!    ▲                  │                              │
//!    │             absent│  ▲                     absent│
//!    │ (held ≥ dwell_down)  └────────present────────────┘
//!    │                  ▼                              ▼
//!    └──────────────  (Clear)        Raised ◀─present─ Clearing
//!                                       └──(held ≥ dwell_down)──▶ Clear
//! ```
//!
//! Mirrors the pure-state-machine pattern of [`multiview_framestore::state`] and
//! [`multiview_overlay::alert`]: the whole transition table is total over
//! `(phase, present, now)` and is exhaustively property-testable with a synthetic
//! injected clock — **no real time, no sleeps** (ADR-MV001 synthetic-fault
//! requirement).
