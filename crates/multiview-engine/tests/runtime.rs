//! Integrated engine-runtime soak/chaos test — invariants #1 and #10 together.
//!
//! This is THE test that proves "one valid frame per tick, on schedule, forever,
//! independent of inputs and clients." It drives the real [`EngineRuntime`] tick
//! loop for a large number of ticks while:
//!
//! * one input store is permanently empty (a stalled/absent producer), and
//! * a contending consumer thread CONCURRENTLY hammers the isolation channels
//!   (subscribes, receives, reads the latest-state slot) — including one
//!   subscriber that never drains, forcing drop-oldest lag.
//!
//! and asserts, for every one of the ticks:
//!
//! * exactly one valid composited frame is produced (the runtime's tick count
//!   advances by exactly one and a fresh snapshot lands in the latest-state slot),
//! * the published `pts` equals an INDEPENDENT i128 oracle (`round(tick * 1e9 *
//!   den / num)`, half away from zero — not computed via the code under test),
//! * the schedule/cadence is kept (the per-tick compose+publish wall-clock
//!   latency stays well below the tick budget), and
//! * the run never stalls (it completes all ticks).
//!
//! Pacing uses the [`ManualTimeSource`] + [`CooperativePacer`] so the loop is
//! fully deterministic with zero real sleeps; the test advances the source to
//! each tick's absolute deadline and confirms the runtime emits exactly that one
//! tick before advancing — which also verifies the runtime never runs ahead of
//! its deadline (it paces to the clock, never free-runs).
