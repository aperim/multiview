//! Output clock holds **wall-clock cadence under overload** (ADR-T018) —
//! invariant #1's true meaning, proven deterministically.
//!
//! The drive loop composes one fresh frame per loop iteration. On a
//! CPU/GPU-contended host a `compose()` can overrun the tick budget; the prior
//! loop then free-ran at *composition* speed, emitting each index late, so
//! media-time fell progressively behind wall-clock (the frigate 84-minute-lag
//! incident). ADR-T018 makes the emitted tick **track wall-clock** by re-emitting
//! the held last-good frame for each whole tick-period that has already elapsed
//! (invariant #2 lifted to the output clock), under a fresh strictly-increasing
//! pts (invariant #3), bounded per iteration (no spin) — so the output holds
//! exactly 1.0× cadence rather than slipping.
//!
//! These tests drive the REAL [`EngineRuntime`] loop with a [`ManualTimeSource`]
//! and [`CooperativePacer`] (zero real sleeps, fully deterministic), simulating a
//! slow compositor by advancing the time source inside the per-tick control hook
//! (i.e. "by the time this fresh compose finished, N tick-periods had elapsed").
