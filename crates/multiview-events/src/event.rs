//! The discriminated event payload — one internally-tagged union for every
//! frame in both directions.
//!
//! Per ADR-RT002 the payload is a Rust internally-tagged enum
//! (`#[serde(tag = "t", content = "data")]`) that renders as a JSON-Schema
//! `oneOf` with a `const` discriminator and maps to a perfect TypeScript
//! discriminated `switch`. Control frames (`$`-prefixed `t`) and data events
//! (dotted `t`) share the one union so a single parse/route path serves WS and
//! SSE.
//!
//! This is **not** `#[serde(untagged)]` (guardrails + conventions §5 forbid it);
//! the explicit `t` tag gives one unambiguous parse path.
