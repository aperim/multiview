//! Subscription topics — the coarse, group-level routing keys.
//!
//! Per the realtime-api brief (§3) topics are deliberately **coarse**: a small
//! fixed set of group-level subscription units, each carrying many fine-grained
//! event types (`Event` variants). Fine scoping is done with an `id` filter,
//! not by adding more topics. The `$control` pseudo-topic carries the control
//! frames ([`crate::event::Event`] control variants) in both directions.
