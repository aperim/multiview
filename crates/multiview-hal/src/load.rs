//! Live per-device load model + the vendor probe seam (ADR-0017).
//!
//! Where [`crate::capability`]/[`crate::cost`]/[`crate::planner`] model what a
//! device *can* do and what *fits*, this module models what a device is *doing
//! right now*: a [`DeviceLoad`] snapshot per GPU (compute-busy, VRAM used/total,
//! per-engine encoder/decoder utilisation, NVENC concurrent-session count). It
//! is the fourth seam in `multiview-hal`, beside the presence-detection
//! [`crate::probe`], and it mirrors that module's discipline exactly:
//!
//! - The **pure load model** ([`DeviceId`], [`DeviceLoad`], [`Vendor`]) always
//!   compiles, with no native deps.
//! - Every field a vendor cannot report is an [`Option`] — "unknown" is a
//!   first-class state, never a fabricated zero
//!   ([gpu-monitoring §2.5](../../../docs/research/gpu-monitoring-and-scheduling.md)).
//!   The selection policy in [`crate::select`] drops an unknown term and
//!   redistributes its weight; it never invents a metric.
//! - The vendor seam is the injectable [`LoadProbe`] trait (mirroring
//!   [`crate::probe::DeviceProbe`]). A [`LoadPoller`] wraps a probe with the
//!   bounded off-hot-path polling contract.
//! - Real vendor probes are feature-gated behind the existing `cuda` / `vaapi`
//!   / `qsv` features. The NVIDIA path (NVML via the runtime-loaded
//!   `nvml-wrapper`) initialises-or-returns-[`LoadSample::Unavailable`]
//!   gracefully on a host with no NVIDIA device — never a panic.
//!
