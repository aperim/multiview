//! # multiview-hal
//!
//! Hardware-abstraction layer for the **Multiview** engine: the pure-Rust
//! capability + cost + planner model that feeds invariants #6
//! (decode-at-display-resolution, budgeted in megapixels/sec) and #9
//! (resource-adaptive degradation).
//!
//! It has these cooperating pieces:
//!
//! - [`capability`] — [`Capability`] descriptors: per `(BackendKind, Stage)`,
//!   the max resolution, accepted pixel formats, and decode-resize support.
//! - [`registry`] — the [`BackendRegistry`]: register/query capabilities by
//!   `(stage, kind)`, seeded with the always-available software tier.
//! - [`cost`] — the [`CostBudget`] and per-tile [`TileLoad`], all in
//!   **megapixels/sec** (never stream count).
//! - [`planner`] — the [`Planner`]: admission control (does a [`Plan`] fit
//!   every engine budget?) plus the hysteresis-controlled, cheapest-impact-first
//!   [`degradation`] ladder (no flapping).
//! - [`load`] — the live per-device [`load::DeviceLoad`] model + the injectable
//!   [`load::LoadProbe`] vendor seam and the off-hot-path [`load::LoadPoller`]
//!   (ADR-0017). The pure model always compiles; vendor probes (NVML via the
//!   runtime-loaded `nvml-wrapper`, Linux sysfs) are feature-gated.
//! - [`select`] — the pure, deterministic affinity-gated least-loaded
//!   [`select::select_device`] placement policy (ADR-0018): pins win, hard gates
//!   build the whole-pipeline candidate set, survivors are scored by a
//!   dominant-resource load model.
//! - [`split`] — the deliberate last-resort multi-GPU [`split::plan_split`]
//!   decision (ADR-0018 §20): reached only when no single GPU can host the whole
//!   island, it cuts at the cheapest point (never fragmenting `composite`),
//!   accounts the cross-GPU host round-trip explicitly, and is gated by a
//!   minimum-gain threshold so a live pipeline is never churned for a marginal
//!   improvement.
//!
//! Hardware probing ([`probe`]) is the only seam that touches vendors. It
//! follows the three-layer model (core-engine §6.2): the injectable
//! [`probe::DeviceProbe`] decides device *presence* (environment detection, no
//! native SDK), and the feature-gated backend crates later refine the resulting
//! [`Capability`] with true vendor caps queries. The native paths live behind
//! off-by-default features (`cuda`, `vaapi`, `qsv`, `videotoolbox`); the default
//! build is pure Rust with no native deps and every hardware probe reports
//! *unavailable*. With a feature on but no device present (CI), the probe still
//! reports *unavailable* cleanly — never a panic. The library target is
//! `multiview_hal`.
//!
//! See [core-engine §6](../../docs/research/core-engine.md),
//! [efficiency](../../docs/research/efficiency.md), ADR-0003, and ADR-0004.
