//! The pure, deterministic affinity-gated least-loaded placement policy
//! (ADR-0018).
//!
//! [`select_device`] answers the governing question: given a pipeline's
//! demand, the candidate GPUs, the live [`DeviceLoad`] snapshots, and any
//! operator pins, **which single GPU should host the whole
//! `decode -> composite -> encode` island?** It is a pure function — no I/O, no
//! native deps, no clock — so it is fully unit-testable with synthetic loads,
//! holding the same "pure core, feature-gated hardware seam" discipline as the
//! rest of the crate.
//!
//! The four ordered stages (ADR-0018 §2):
//!
//! 1. **Pins win (hard, first).** An operator pin to a stable [`DeviceId`] is
//!    honoured unconditionally if that device is a candidate; an unsatisfiable
//!    pin is surfaced as a [`RejectReason::PinUnsatisfiable`], never silently
//!    relocated.
//! 2. **Hard gates build the candidate set — affinity is a GATE.** A GPU is a
//!    candidate only if it can host the *whole* island: capability
//!    ([`Capability::supports`]), the per-engine Mpix/s cost budget (the
//!    existing [`Planner::admit`], applied per GPU), predicted pool bytes `<=`
//!    free VRAM, and — for NVENC encode placement — the discovered per-system
//!    concurrent-session ceiling (tracked, never hard-coded). A GPU failing any
//!    hard gate is dropped. We never split a pipeline here; a split is the
//!    caller's explicit last-resort path.
//! 3. **Score the survivors** by a dominant-resource (DRF-style) load model,
//!    lower = least-loaded. VRAM carries the highest weight; an **unknown**
//!    vendor term drops out and its weight is redistributed to the known terms
//!    — never fabricated. A GPU whose dominant resource exceeds the configured
//!    headroom ceiling is rejected/degraded rather than chosen.
//! 4. Ties (within an epsilon band) break deterministically: lowest stable
//!    [`DeviceId`] index.
//!
//! See [gpu-placement-engine](../../../docs/research/gpu-placement-engine.md)
//! and ADR-0018.
