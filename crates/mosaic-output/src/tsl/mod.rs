//! TSL UMD protocol **encoders** (v3.1 / v4.0 / v5.0).
//!
//! This is the **egress** half of Mosaic's TSL UMD support: pure typed
//! [`UmdMessage`] → on-wire bytes. The matching wire **decoders** live in
//! `mosaic-input`'s `tsl` module. The two halves share an identical value model
//! (defined independently in each crate — `mosaic-input` and `mosaic-output` do
//! not, and must not, depend on one another) so that an encode∘decode round trip
//! is the identity for any representable message.
//!
//! Encoders are **pure**: value-in, bytes-out, no I/O. The UDP/TCP/serial
//! sockets that carry them are a later integration (the codecs are socket-free so
//! they stay golden-vector and round-trip testable, and they never touch the
//! engine hot path).
//!
//! See the [`v31`], [`v40`] and [`v50`] modules for the per-generation wire
//! layouts (they mirror the decoder docs in `mosaic-input::tsl`). Tally is taken
//! from [`mosaic_core::tally`] via the [`TallyLamp`] helper and written back to
//! the 2-bit wire codes.
