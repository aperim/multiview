//! The engine→control tally ingest: a read-only, lossy, lagged-skip subscriber
//! that mirrors engine [`TallyEvent`](mosaic_events::TallyEvent)s into the
//! [`TallyMirror`].
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #10) is the load-bearing property
//!
//! Ingest subscribes to the engine's drop-oldest event broadcast
//! ([`EventSubscription`]) and **only ever reads**. It never sends on a path the
//! engine awaits and never blocks the engine's publish. A slow mirror or a burst
//! of tally changes cannot back-pressure the engine: when this subscriber falls
//! behind, the broadcast reports [`RecvError::Lagged`] and ingest **resubscribes
//! at the head** (lagged-skip), dropping the intermediate states it missed.
//! Missing an intermediate tally change is safe — the next
//! [`TallyEvent`](mosaic_events::TallyEvent) for a target carries the current
//! resolved state, so the mirror re-converges.
//!
//! The ingest is a pure classifier ([`crate::tally_state::tally_observation`])
//! plus a thin drive loop, so the "which events are tally observations" decision
//! is exhaustively unit-testable with no async, sockets, or sleeps.
