//! External **router/switcher control** — SW-P-08 and Ember+ drivers, the route
//! table, and **route-follow** into the tally arbiter (broadcast-multiviewer
//! brief §2/§8).
//!
//! A broadcast router crosspoints sources to destinations. Mosaic uses this for
//! two operator features:
//!
//! * **Name-following UMD** — when a destination's feed changes, the UMD label
//!   under the corresponding tile follows the *source's* name.
//! * **Route-follow tally** — a destination that is on a tally bus (program /
//!   preview) lights the tile that is currently routed to it.
//!
//! The two openly-published control protocols are the **pure codecs** in
//! [`swp08`] and [`ember`]. This module adds the protocol-agnostic [`RouteTable`]
//! (latest-wins destination→source map, the control-plane mirror of the router's
//! crosspoint state) and the pure [`route_follow`] step that turns a router route
//! report plus a [`RouteBinding`] into a tally/UMD update the existing
//! [`TallyMirror`](crate::tally_state::TallyMirror) records — with **no engine
//! back-pressure** (invariant #10): the route mirror is control-plane state only,
//! fed lossily, and the lamp it computes is *submitted* to the engine arbiter
//! exactly like a manual override.
//!
//! The live TCP/serial socket to a router is behind the off-by-default `router`
//! feature (`transport`); the codecs and the route-follow logic above are
//! always compiled and tested.
