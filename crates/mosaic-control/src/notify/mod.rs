//! Northbound alarm notifiers: webhook and email.
//!
//! When the engine's monitoring/alarm subsystem raises, updates, clears, or
//! acknowledges an alarm (broadcast-multiviewer brief §4: "northbound SNMP
//! traps, syslog, email, webhook"), the control plane fans the transition out to
//! configured northbound destinations. This module owns that fan-out.
//!
//! ## Pure builders, sends behind config
//!
//! Per the build plan the notifiers are **pure builders**: turning an
//! [`AlarmTransition`](mosaic_events::AlarmTransition) plus a destination
//! configuration into a fully-formed request value (a [`webhook::WebhookRequest`]
//! or an [`email::EmailMessage`]) is a total, side-effect-free function that is
//! exhaustively unit-testable with no network. The *actual* send is a thin,
//! separately-driven step:
//!
//! * the **webhook** send rides the crate's existing HTTP stack and is always
//!   available;
//! * the **email** send uses `lettre` and lives behind the off-by-default
//!   `email` feature, so the default build pulls no SMTP/native dependency and
//!   stays cargo-deny-clean.
//!
//! ## Per-severity routing
//!
//! A [`SeverityRouter`] maps each X.733 [`PerceivedSeverity`] to the set of
//! destinations that should be notified, so an operator can (for example) page
//! on `Critical`/`Major` over email while logging everything to a webhook. The
//! router is a pure predicate over the alarm record; it never performs I/O.
