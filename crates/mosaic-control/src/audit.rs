//! The change **audit log** (M6 management hardening; broadcast brief §8 "RBAC
//! multi-user + audit log").
//!
//! Every successful mutation the control plane applies is recorded here:
//! **who** (the authenticated principal's key id), **what** (the action +
//! addressed object), and **when** (a media-timeline timestamp). The log is
//! **append-only** and **read-only over HTTP** — there is no route that mutates
//! it — so it is a faithful, tamper-resistant record of operator activity.
//!
//! Like every store in this crate, the audit log holds control-plane state only
//! and is never on the engine's data plane, so however it synchronizes
//! internally it cannot back-pressure the engine (invariant #10).
