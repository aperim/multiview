//! The native **WHEP preview egress** transport (feature `native`, ADR-P006).
//!
//! This relocates the preview-local str0m duplication onto the crate's single
//! str0m [`Session`](crate::transport::Session) (ADR-0048 / ADR-P006 move 1):
//! WHEP preview viewers, WHEP output viewers, and WHIP ingest all ride one str0m
//! owner, one DTLS certificate, and one dual-stack UDP socket. [`WhepEgress`]
//! implements the pure `multiview_preview::whep::transport::WhepTransport` seam,
//! so the control plane stays codec/native-free and only the cli (which already
//! links this crate behind a feature) wires the live path.
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! * [`WhepEgress::accept_session`] — parse the browser WHEP offer with str0m
//!   (real ICE credentials + a real self-signed DTLS fingerprint), take the
//!   source's bounded **drop-oldest** video [`SampleFeed`] (and, when the offer
//!   negotiated an Opus audio m-line, its audio feed — ADR-P006), and return an
//!   [`EgressAnswer`] carrying both the preview-core [`TransportAnswer`] *and*
//!   str0m's own complete answer SDP (BUNDLE / mid / rtcp-mux / fmtp — ADR-P006
//!   move 2, never a hand-rolled rebuild).
//! * [`WhepEgress::drive_egress`] — the egress step the endpoint driver pumps:
//!   drain the drop-oldest feeds → [`Session::write_video_sample`] /
//!   [`Session::write_audio_sample`] → SRTP → the outbound datagrams the driver
//!   sends over the shared socket. The first video sample is gated on a keyframe
//!   so a late joiner decodes immediately.
//! * [`WhepEgress::handle_datagram`] / [`WhepEgress::poll_timeout`] — feed
//!   received datagrams in and report the next wake, so the endpoint driver can
//!   multiplex this session on the shared socket.
//! * [`WhepEgress::close`] — terminal lifecycle + immediate `Rtc`/feed release; a
//!   closed entry is kept as a queryable tombstone (idempotent WHEP `DELETE`).
//!
//! Because str0m is sans-IO, the whole path — handshake + SRTP egress — runs over
//! an in-memory packet shuttle with **no socket** and is unit-tested in CI
//! (`tests/whep_egress.rs`). The live browser-play leg is hardware-gated.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #10 — the cardinal preview rule)
//!
//! A WHEP egress session is a *preview* consumer. It drains drop-oldest
//! [`SampleFeed`]s and owns only its `Rtc` plus a lifecycle handle; it never holds
//! a handle the engine awaits, never publishes onto the protected output path, and
//! a stalled or absent browser player merely loses the oldest buffered samples —
//! the producer pushing into the feed is never back-pressured, and other sessions
//! are unaffected. The session map is the transport's own mutex-guarded
//! bookkeeping, never an engine lock.
