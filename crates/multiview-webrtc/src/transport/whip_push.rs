//! The `whip_push` **output client** — **feature `native`** (ADR-0049 §5.2,
//! ADR-0048 §7).
//!
//! Multiview is the RFC 9725 **client**: it publishes the program to a remote
//! WHIP ingest. The client builds a **sendonly** offer with host candidates +
//! `a=setup:actpass` (the answerer chooses the DTLS role — RFC 5763 answerers
//! typically pick `active`, so Multiview commonly runs the DTLS **server** role),
//! `POST`s it with the configured Bearer, applies the answer, and sample-writes
//! the program AUs drained from the shared
//! [`EgressFeed`](crate::egress::EgressFeed). It is **supervised with backoff
//! reconnect** exactly like the RTMP/SRT push clients.
//!
//! ## What is pure vs live
//!
//! [`WhipPushOffer`] (the sendonly-actpass-host-candidates offer) and
//! [`PushBackoff`] (the supervised reconnect schedule) are **pure** and CI-tested
//! offline; the offer→answer→connected lifecycle and media egress are proven in
//! memory over the `Session` shuttle (`tests/egress_native.rs`). The HTTP `POST`
//! to a real WHIP origin + the live UDP socket loop ([`WhipPushClient::run`]) are
//! the live legs, hardware-gated (a real OBS/MediaMTX ingest), not run in CI.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariants #1 / #10)
//!
//! The push client is a fan-out consumer: program AUs cross only the bounded
//! drop-oldest [`EgressFeed`], and the driver never `.await`s the remote (UDP
//! send is non-blocking). A stalled or dead WHIP target loses *its* media and
//! triggers a supervised reconnect; it can never stall the encode-once fan-out or
//! the output clock. PTS are re-stamped from the tick at encode (invariant #3).
