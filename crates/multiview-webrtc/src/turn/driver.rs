//! The shared sans-IO **TURN relay driver** (ADR-0048 §5.1).
//!
//! Both endpoint drivers — the WHIP-ingest endpoint ([`crate::transport`], async
//! tokio over the shared UDP socket) and the WHEP-egress preview driver (in the
//! cli, a sync socket loop) — must run their configured TURN clients over their
//! own socket and harvest the allocated relay address so str0m can offer it as a
//! relay candidate. [`TurnRelayDriver`] wraps one [`TurnClient`] per configured
//! TURN server with the build / pump / feed / harvest steps both endpoints need,
//! so the [`TurnClient`] (the shared machinery) is reused and the driving glue
//! lives in one place — never re-implemented or duplicated per endpoint.
//!
//! It is **pure / sans-IO**: it never owns a socket. The caller pulls outbound
//! datagrams with [`TurnRelayDriver::poll_transmit`] and sends them on its own
//! socket; pushes received datagrams in with [`TurnRelayDriver::feed`]; and reads
//! the newly-learned relays with [`TurnRelayDriver::take_new_relays`]. This keeps
//! it offline-testable against the in-process fake TURN server, and lets the sync
//! (WHEP) and async (WHIP) endpoints drive it the same way.
