//! Failing-first, **offline** tests for the `whip_push` **output client**
//! ([`multiview_webrtc::transport::WhipPushClient`], feature `native`, ADR-0049
//! §5.2).
//!
//! Multiview is the RFC 9725 client: it builds a **sendonly** offer with host
//! candidates + `a=setup:actpass`, the remote ingest answers, the client applies
//! the answer and sample-writes the program AUs. These prove the offer shape, the
//! offer→answer→connected lifecycle over the in-memory shuttle, that program AUs
//! drained from the [`EgressFeed`](multiview_webrtc::egress::EgressFeed) reach the
//! remote, and that the supervisor's backoff resets / grows on connect / drop —
//! all without a socket or a real WHIP origin.
