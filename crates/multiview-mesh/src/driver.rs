//! The always-on announce + browse **driver** (ADR-0051 §2/§5, brief §9.1) —
//! the `mdns` feature only (it needs `tokio` for the timed loop).
//!
//! The driver is the off-hot-loop task the daemon spawns: it periodically
//! **announces** this machine's signed [`AnnouncePayload`] over the
//! [`MeshTransport`] and **browses** for neighbours, folding each received
//! announcement (untrusted) into the shared [`MeshState`] and aging out peers it
//! has stopped hearing from. It is generic over the transport, so the pure step
//! ([`announce_browse_step`]) is unit-testable **offline** with an in-memory fake;
//! the live mDNS service ([`crate::service::MdnsService`]) is one transport impl.
//!
//! ## Untrusted inventory (ADR-0041 doctrine)
//!
//! A received announcement populates the **untrusted** inventory (digest + claim
//! state) — it is **never** auto-trusted or auto-relayed. The originator-signed
//! summary lets a receiver detect a spoof/tamper *once the peer's key is known*
//! (the O2 key-distribution step, operator-confirm); at discovery a peer is simply
//! recorded untrusted, exactly the SAP/managed-device contract.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #10)
//!
//! Every transport op is best-effort: a failure is logged and the loop carries on.
//! The browse drain is non-blocking; the loop sleeps between rounds and never
//! blocks on the network. The driver holds no engine handle and can never
//! back-pressure the engine — a wedged or failed mesh loop never stalls anything.
