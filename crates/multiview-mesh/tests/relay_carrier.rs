//! The relay carrier model (ADR-0051 §4, brief §9.2): the relayer is a **dumb
//! carrier**. It carries an end-to-end-signed lease binding (the FILE-exchange
//! artefact) between an offline originator and the licence server; it lacks both
//! keys, so it can neither read past the signed envelope nor forge/alter the
//! assertion. A tampered relayed payload fails the originator/server signature
//! check and is rejected. The relay queue is bounded drop-oldest (invariant #10).
