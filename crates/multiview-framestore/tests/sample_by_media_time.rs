//! Latch-on-tick sampling: the output clock samples each tile by **output media
//! time**, selecting the frame whose source-relative `media_time` is
//! *nearest-but-not-after* the requested instant (streaming-gotchas §1).
//!
//! This is the regression guard for the "file/VOD tile races ultra-fast then
//! freezes" bug: when the output loop runs slower than real-time, the ingest
//! thread (which decodes ahead) had published many frames into the store, and a
//! `latest-wins` read sampled the newest one — so the tile's content raced far
//! ahead of the output's own media clock. Sampling by media time makes the tile
//! advance 1:1 with output time regardless of how fast frames were produced.
