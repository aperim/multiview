//! The **tap registry**: lazy-start, subscriber refcounting, and auto-stop.
//!
//! A *tap* is the single shared, read-only side-channel onto one pipeline entity
//! (an input slot, the program canvas, or one output rendition). Per the preview
//! brief (§3 efficiency, §2 isolation):
//!
//! * **At most one tap per entity, fanned out to many viewers.** N viewers cost
//!   the same as one: the tap produces one thumbnail stream that every viewer's
//!   [`TapLease`] subscribes to.
//! * **Lazy-start on the first subscriber.** The expensive resource (a downscale
//!   blit, a cue decoder, a per-output decode) is created only when the first
//!   [`TapRegistry::subscribe`] arrives — *cost is ~zero when nobody is
//!   watching.*
//! * **Auto-stop on the last leave.** When the final [`TapLease`] is dropped the
//!   registry runs the tap's stop callback, tearing the resource down. A later
//!   subscriber lazily starts it again.
//!
//! ## Isolation (invariant #10)
//!
//! Each [`TapLease`] holds a [`mosaic_engine::isolation::EventSubscription`] — a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` receiver onto a bounded **drop-oldest** ring the
//! engine publishes into with a non-blocking `send`. A lease that never reads,
//! reads slowly, or is dropped **cannot** back-pressure the engine: it merely
//! lags and loses the oldest buffered frames. The registry's own bookkeeping
//! uses a short-lived `std::sync::Mutex` that the engine's publish path **never
//! touches**, so it can never stall the engine either.
