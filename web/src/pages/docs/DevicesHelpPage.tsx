            <Trans>
              A managed device is a piece of hardware Multiview supervises: a
              hardware decoder feeding a TV, a display node driving a video
              wall, or a cast target. The device entry you adopt is desired
              state — driver, management address, mode, credentials — and a
              supervised driver continuously converges the real device onto
              it: it probes, reconnects, re-applies the mode, and reports
              status.
            </Trans>
          </Prose>
          <Prose>
            <Trans>
              Devices never carry the program: Multiview's program output
              never depends on any device. If a device fails, sources bound to
              it ride the normal tile ladder and outputs ride their failover
              policy — the multiview keeps running while the driver works on
              recovery.

              <Trans>
                Present only in the untrusted discovery inventory — not a
                device yet. Adoption is always an explicit operator action.

              <Trans>
                Reachable. DEGRADED means the device itself reports a fault —
                a stalled decode, over-temperature — while its management
                channel still answers. Program output is unaffected either
                way.

            </DocTerm>
            <DocTerm term={<Trans>AUTH_FAILED</Trans>}>
              <Trans>
                The device rejected its credentials. Distinct from
                UNREACHABLE: there are no blind retries — probing pauses until
                the credentials secret reference is updated, then resumes
                automatically.

            </DocTerm>
            <DocTerm term={<Trans>UNREACHABLE</Trans>}>
              <Trans>
                The device stopped answering. The control plane reconnects
                with backoff and jitter (exactly like input reconnect), raises
                the configured offline alarm after a dwell, and re-converges
                the desired state when the device returns. "Probe now"
                overrides a parked backoff.

          <Prose>
            <Trans>
              Drivers are compiled in; each maps its device family onto the
              same capability shape (encode, decode, display, sync, audio,
              reboot, firmware update). Support statements below describe our
              own integration against publicly observable interfaces — they
              are not vendor endorsements.

          <DocDefinitions>
            <DocTerm term={<Code>zowietek</Code>}>
              <Trans>
                Supports ZowieBox-class encoder/decoder appliances: probing,
                encoder/decoder mode convergence, stream enumeration for
                source binding, decode-slot binding for outputs, reboot, and
                temperature. Sync is bounded-skew only (see the sync guide).

            </DocTerm>
            <DocTerm term={<Code>displaynode</Code>}>
              <Trans>
                Multiview's own display-node software for single-board
                computers and spare PCs driving displays; enrolled nodes are
                located by their keypair identity rather than an address, and
                present frame-accurate synchronized output.

            <DocTerm term={<Code>cast</Code>}>
              <Trans>
                Supports casting a stream to media renderers on the network
                (ad-hoc, best-effort). Cast targets are never part of a
                synchronized canvas and ad-hoc sessions never raise major
                alarms.

          <Prose>
            <Trans>
              A device's streams become ordinary managed Sources, and its
              decode slots become ordinary managed Outputs, each carrying a{" "}
              <Code>device_ref</Code> annotation in its body. The engine's
              ingest and serving paths are untouched — the binding only tells
              the driver which device the resource belongs to (and blocks
              deleting the device while something still references it). Where
              a vendor does not document a stream URL, the UI flags the
              candidate as unverified and you supply the URL yourself — it is
              never silently guessed.
