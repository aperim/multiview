# Multiview

**Turn many live video feeds into one dependable multiviewer.** Multiview ingests your
cameras, encoders and streams, composites them into a clean, templated wall on the GPU, and
serves that wall out in the formats your facility already uses — engineered to run well on
ordinary hardware and to **never drop a frame**.

## Why Multiview

- **Output that never falters.** A single fixed-cadence clock emits one valid, correctly-timed
  frame every tick — *forever*, independent of any input. A dead camera shows a "no signal"
  tile; it never freezes, stalls or corrupts the wall.
- **Runs on commodity hardware.** NVIDIA, Intel, AMD or Apple Silicon — or pure software as a
  universal fallback. Multiview decodes at display size, stays NV12 end-to-end, keeps frames on
  the GPU, and sheds load tile-by-tile under pressure before the program output is ever touched.
- **Many sources in, many destinations out.** RTSP, HLS, MPEG-TS, SRT, RTMP, NDI, files and
  synthetic test patterns in; composite **once** and fan the same stream out to RTSP, HLS/LL-HLS,
  NDI, RTMP and SRT.
- **Built to be operated.** Declarative TOML config, an embedded web UI, and a REST/WebSocket/SSE
  API with interactive OpenAPI docs — scriptable and automatable end to end.
- **Source-available and license-clean.** Pure Rust under the **Multiview Source-Available
  Non-Commercial License** — free for genuine personal/home and other non-commercial use (a
  commercial licence is required otherwise) — with a default build that is LGPL-clean.

## Quick start

The fastest way to see it running. This brings up the engine plus a small companion that
publishes a **synthetic** test feed (no real or private sources), composites a 2×2 wall, encodes
it, serves the result as HLS, and serves the web UI + API on `:8080`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aperim/multiview.git
cd multiview
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml up -d
```

Then open:

- **Web UI** — <http://localhost:8080/> (manage the engine)
- **API playground** — <http://localhost:8080/docs> (interactive OpenAPI / Scalar)
- **The multiview** — `vlc http://localhost:8888/multiview.m3u8` (or any HLS player)

Edit [`deploy/config/multiview.toml`](deploy/config/multiview.toml) to point a tile at your own
source and re-run `up -d`. Tear down with `docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml down -v`.

> The default image is LGPL-clean and encodes **MPEG-2** (open it in VLC/ffplay). For
> browser-friendly **H.264**, use the `-gpl` image. GPU one-liners (NVIDIA / VAAPI) and the full
> configuration reference are in **[docs/operations](docs/operations/)**.

## Install

| Method | Get it |
|--------|--------|
| **Container (recommended)** | `docker pull ghcr.io/aperim/multiview:latest` (multi-arch `amd64`+`arm64`, SLSA provenance + cosign-signed). NVIDIA variant: `:latest-nvidia`. |
| **Prebuilt binaries** | Linux (`x86_64`/`aarch64`) and macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel, signed + notarized) on the [Releases page](https://github.com/aperim/multiview/releases). Requires FFmpeg 7.x on the host. |
| **From source** | `cargo build` (pure-Rust, LGPL-clean default). Feature presets and the FFmpeg/toolchain requirements are in **[docs/operations/building.md](docs/operations/building.md)**. |

## What it does

Multiview is a headless, scriptable compositor and router. It samples many independent live
inputs into a fixed, templated canvas and encodes that canvas **once per rendition** — then fans
the same packets to every transport. Inputs are *sampled*, never allowed to *pace* the output, so
one misbehaving source can never warp or stall the wall.

| Area | In brief |
|------|----------|
| **Inputs** | RTSP · HLS · MPEG-TS · SRT · RTMP · NDI · file · synthetic — supervised reconnect, jitter buffering, per-input timestamp normalization. |
| **Compositor** | A custom GPU-native pass: scale + place + per-tile colour-convert + linear-light blend + overlays. Hot-reconfigurable grid/PiP layouts. |
| **Outputs** | RTSP · HLS · Apple LL-HLS · NDI · RTMP · SRT via encode-once-mux-many. |
| **Audio** | Per-input decode/resample/mix, discrete tracks + an EBU R128 program bus, silence-fill on dropout. |
| **Subtitles & overlays** | CEA-608/708, DVB-sub, teletext, WebVTT/SRT/ASS; text, clocks, logos, tally, alert cards, audio meters. |
| **Control & preview** | Embedded React web UI, axum REST/WS/SSE API with OpenAPI 3.1, and sub-second WHEP/MJPEG preview — strictly isolated from the program path. |

The complete capability/status matrix is in **[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)**.

## Licensing

Project code is **source-available**, licensed under the **Multiview Source-Available
Non-Commercial License** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) — © Aperim Pty Ltd. It is **free** for genuine

Broadcasters; small Community Broadcasters; smaller Content Creators) defined in the License. All
other use — businesses, education, government, productization/appliances, and streamers/creators —
is Commercial Use and requires a paid Commercial License; see
[`LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md`](LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md) (licensing@aperim.com). This is a source-available
licence, **not** an open-source or free-software licence.

The **default build remains LGPL-clean** (FFmpeg linked LGPL; all scaling/compositing in-house).
Two capabilities are strictly opt-in and change the licensing of the resulting build:

- **`gpl-codecs`** — adds x264/x265 → the build becomes **GPL**.
- **`ndi`** — uses the proprietary, runtime-loaded NDI SDK (never vendored) under its EULA with
  mandatory attribution: *NDI® is a registered trademark of Vizrt NDI AB.*

Codec **patent** licensing (H.264/HEVC/AAC) is separate from software copyright and may apply to
your outputs regardless of build flags. Full model: [conventions.md §7](docs/architecture/conventions.md)
