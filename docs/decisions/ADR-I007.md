# ADR-I007: CONSPECT-3 device proof-of-possession (PoP) on the heartbeat client

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Area:** Implementation build-out
- **Date:** 2026-06-17
- **Source:** operator (Conspect API v0.9.0 is now **enforcing** device-PoP on the device-mutating ops; the merged renew-only heartbeat client — account-JWT only, no PoP — is rejected `pop-invalid`, so leases can no longer renew). Refines [ADR-0096](ADR-0096.md) D2 and [ADR-I006](ADR-I006.md) decision point 11.

## Context

The merged renew-only heartbeat client (PR #177, [ADR-I006](ADR-I006.md)) authenticates with
the account-JWT `Authorization: Bearer` chain only. ADR-0096 D2 recorded that the device PoP
key was *captured and stored* (`devicePublicKey`) but that **authenticating a request with it
was deferred server-side** ("slice 5d"). That deferral has ended: **Conspect API v0.9.0 now
enforces device proof-of-possession** on the four device-mutating operations
(activate/heartbeat/rebind/deactivate). A heartbeat without a valid `Conspect-Device-PoP`
header is rejected `pop-required`/`pop-invalid` (401), so the renew-only client can no longer
renew a lease. This is **security-critical and currently broken in production**.

The wire (extracted byte-exact from the authoritative spec
`/tmp/salvage/conspect-openapi.v0.9.0.json` — there is no golden vector or integration guide
available locally, so the spec descriptions are the sole authority, mirroring how #177's
`leaseBytes` CBOR had to be reproduced):

- **`GET /v0/devices/licence/challenge?orgId=…`** (account-JWT bearer, organisation **operator**
  role floor) → `DeviceChallenge { nonce: ^[0-9a-f]{64}$ (32 bytes / 64 lower-case hex,
  single-use, ~120 s TTL), expiresAtMs }`. A cross-tenant `orgId` is a byte-identical 404.
- **`HeartbeatRequest`** gains a **required** `nonce` field (`^[0-9a-f]{64}$`): the `nextNonce`
  from the prior heartbeat/activate response (RFC 9449 DPoP-nonce style), or a fresh
  `/challenge` at cold start.
- **`HeartbeatResponse`** gains a **required** `nextNonce` (`^[0-9a-f]{64}$`) — so steady-state
  renewal needs **no** extra `/challenge` round-trip.
- **`Conspect-Device-PoP` header** (`required: false` in the schema, but **handler-enforced**:
  a missing/empty header is `pop-required` 401, a failing proof is `pop-invalid` 401): a
  **base64 COSE_Sign1** the device signs over the canonical PoP pre-image
  `htm | htu | sha256(body) | instance_id | nonce | iat` with the binding's bound **Ed25519
  device key**. The server "pins Ed25519, recomputes the pre-image from the actual request,
  verifies against the … STORED key (continuity), checks the **iat ±60 s** leeway, and burns
  the single-use nonce." `devicePublicKey` is the base64url of the raw 32-byte point; the server
  embeds its **RFC 7638 thumbprint** as the lease `cnf_jkt` (holder-of-key).

The renew-only client **dropped `activate`**, which is where a device keypair would have been
generated — so the client today holds **only a configured public-key string**
(`DeviceIdentity::device_public_key_b64url`, captured-but-unused) and **has no private key to
sign with**. PoP therefore requires adding device keypair **generation + durable persistence**.

Binding constraints (the crate's reason to exist):
[`multiview-licence/CLAUDE.md`](../../crates/multiview-licence/CLAUDE.md) — the crate
**computes data and verifies signatures, and nothing else**: no engine handle, **no I/O**, and
**no key generation / no RNG in non-test code** (data minimisation). The default `cargo check`
/ `cargo deny` must stay a network-free, LGPL-clean shell. The never-off-air invariants (#1
output-clock, #10 isolation) bind any licensing code: **any** PoP failure must fail closed
gracefully (skip this cycle, keep last-good, back off), never panic, never tighten output.

## Decision

Add device-PoP to the heartbeat path as part of the off-by-default `heartbeat` feature, split
across the leaf crate (pure, byte-exact, unit-tested crypto) and the cli boundary (the I/O:
keypair generation + persistence + the HTTP transport), respecting the crate's no-I/O /
no-keygen invariant.

### 1. COSE library — `coset` 0.4.2 (`dep:coset`, under `heartbeat`, in `multiview-licence`)

`coset` (Apache-2.0) builds the COSE_Sign1 with `CoseSign1Builder`. Its **only** runtime deps
are `ciborium` + `ciborium-io` — **already in the `multiview-licence` graph** (the crate uses
`ciborium 0.2.2`), so it adds **zero new transitive crates** and is fully `cargo deny`-clean
(no allowlist change). `CoseSign1Builder::create_signature(aad, |tbs| signer.sign(tbs))` hands
the closure the canonical COSE `Sig_structure` (`"Signature1"`) bytes to sign — the protected
header (`alg = EdDSA = -8`) must be set first. `to_vec()` produces the **untagged** 4-element
array `[protected, unprotected, payload, signature]`; the header value is the **standard-base64**
(RFC 4648 §4) of those bytes.

### 2. Device keypair — generated + durably persisted at the **cli boundary** (`licence.rs`)

The Ed25519 device keypair is **generated once** (the only RNG use; cli-side, never the leaf
crate) and **persisted** to `<lease-dir>/device-key.ed25519` (the same dir as the lease state
and the idempotency nonce) with restrictive perms (`0600`), via the same crash-durable
write-temp → fsync → rename → fsync-parent protocol the `FileNonceStore` already uses. Reload
on restart gives a **stable device identity** (continuity — the server verifies against the
*stored* key). The 32-byte seed is the only secret on disk; it is never logged. A
generate-once-then-reuse `DeviceKeyStore` at the cli boundary owns this; the leaf crate receives
a loaded signer through a seam.

**Provisioning model — client-generated, persisted on first run (SSH-host-key style).** The
device keypair is **minted by the device on first boot** and reused forever after, exactly like
an SSH host key. The generated **public** key is the device's identity: it is what populates
`devicePublicKey` (base64url raw-32) on the eventual activate, and its RFC 7638 thumbprint is the
lease `cnf_jkt` (holder-of-key) the server binds. This **supersedes the existing captured-but-
unused `MULTIVIEW_LICENCE_DEVICE_KEY` placeholder** (`DeviceIdentity::device_public_key_b64url`):
that env var carried only a **public-key string** (forward-compat for the deferred activate, and
never sent on the renew path) — a public key cannot sign a PoP, so it was never the credential.
The authoritative device key is now the **generated + persisted private** key in `DeviceKeyStore`;
the `MULTIVIEW_LICENCE_DEVICE_KEY` placeholder is inert for PoP and is a deprecation candidate
(left in place this slice to avoid churning the cli config contract, since it is not load-bearing
for PoP). **No operator-provisioned device key is supported** — there is no secure way for an
operator to hand a *private* key in via the current env/config surface (env vars are gitignored
+ read-denied but still process-visible; the secret belongs only on the device's disk), and the
SSH-host-key model needs none. If an operator-provisioned model is ever wanted (e.g. a
pre-seeded fleet image), it would drop a `device-key.ed25519` seed into the lease dir before
first boot and `DeviceKeyStore::load_or_generate` would load it unchanged — but that is out of
scope here and not built.

### 3. The signer seam — `DeviceSigner` (leaf crate), implemented by the cli

```rust
pub trait DeviceSigner: Send + Sync {
    /// The raw 32-byte Ed25519 public point (the binding's bound device key).
    fn public_key_raw(&self) -> [u8; 32];
    /// Deterministic Ed25519 signature over `message` (RFC 8032 — no RNG).
    fn sign(&self, message: &[u8]) -> [u8; 64];
}
```

Ed25519 signing is **deterministic** (RFC 8032), so the signer needs **no RNG** — the leaf
crate's no-RNG invariant holds (only *generation* needs entropy, and that stays in the cli). A
loaded `SigningKey` signs; the leaf crate holds it through the seam exactly like the existing
`NowMs` / `NonceStore` seams. A `FixedDeviceSigner` test impl (a known seed) lets the leaf
crate's tests build a proof **and verify it against the public key** byte-exactly.

### 4. Canonical PoP pre-image + COSE_Sign1 — pure, in the leaf crate

A hand-rolled, total `canonical_pop_preimage(htm, htu, body, instance_id, nonce_hex, iat)`
mirrors the existing `canonical_key_preimage` style. The pre-image is a **deterministic-CBOR
`map(6)`** over the field order the spec names —
`htm | htu | sha256(body) | instance_id | nonce | iat` — encoded as:

| field | CBOR encoding |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `htm` | text string — the upper-case HTTP method (`"POST"`) |
| `htu` | text string — the full request URI (scheme+host+path, no query) |
| `sha256_body` | byte string — the raw 32-byte SHA-256 of the exact request body bytes |
| `instance_id` | text string — `DeviceIdentity::instance_id` |
| `nonce` | byte string — the **32 raw bytes** decoded from the 64-hex challenge nonce |
| `iat` | unsigned int — issued-at in **epoch seconds** (the server checks ±60 s) |

These pre-image bytes are the COSE_Sign1 **payload** (attached); the signature covers the COSE
`Sig_structure` wrapping `protected ‖ external_aad(empty) ‖ payload`. `pop_header_value(...)`
returns the standard-base64 of the untagged COSE_Sign1 — the `Conspect-Device-PoP` header value.

> **Spec ambiguities held as rule-26 follow-ups (flagged in the PR; the operator validates
> against the live server).** The spec gives the pre-image in `a | b | …` notation and does not
> spell out the concrete byte-layout, the iat unit (seconds inferred from the ±60 s leeway), or
> whether the payload is attached vs detached. The header **example** (`g1gg…`) decodes to
> `0x83 0x58 0x20 …` = a CBOR **array(3)** + 32-byte bstr, whereas a standard untagged

> emit the canonical 4-element form `coset` produces. The chosen pre-image CBOR map shape is the
> house style (matching the proven `canonical_key_preimage`); these are the load-bearing
> bytes the live server must confirm.

### 5. Nonce lifecycle — cold-start `/challenge`, steady-state `nextNonce`

A `LicenceServer::fetch_challenge(org) -> DeviceChallenge` method is added to the seam (the cli
implements it with the live `GET /challenge`). The `HeartbeatClient` holds the **PoP challenge
nonce** as control-plane state (a `Mutex<Option<PopNonce>>`, loop-only): on cold start (no held
nonce) it fetches `/challenge`; steady-state it uses the prior `HeartbeatResponse::next_nonce`.
This PoP nonce is **entirely separate** from the durable idempotency-key mint counter
(`FileNonceStore`) — they are different things (one is the server's single-use PoP challenge,
the other is the client's retry-stable mutation key) and are never conflated.

### 6. Wire on `heartbeat()` — header + `nonce` body field

The `LicenceServer::heartbeat` seam gains a `pop_header: &str` parameter (the base64
COSE_Sign1); `HeartbeatRequest` gains the `nonce` field. The cli's `ConspectHttpServer` attaches
`Conspect-Device-PoP` alongside the existing `Authorization: Bearer` + `Idempotency-Key`. The
`sha256(body)` in the pre-image is computed over the **exact serialized request body** the
transport sends, so the device and server hash the same bytes.

### 7. Fail closed (never off air, invariants #1/#10)

Every PoP failure mode keeps last-good and skips the cycle, exactly like #177's other failure
paths — a new `HeartbeatError::Pop(PopError)` variant joins the existing fail-closed set
(`Transport`/`KeyTrust`/`SignedLease`/`NonceStore` etc.):

- **No PoP nonce** (cold-start `/challenge` unreachable, or a missing/empty `nextNonce`) → no
  heartbeat mutation this cycle; keep last-good; back off; retry (fetch `/challenge` next cycle).
- **Nonce expired** (`expiresAtMs` in the past, or the server rejects it `pop-invalid`) →
  discard it, fetch fresh next cycle; keep last-good.
- **Signing error / keypair unavailable / unreadable** → keep last-good; back off; the engine
  is untouched (the heartbeat task holds no engine handle, so it is physically unable to stall
  output, just as the leaf-crate invariant guarantees).
- **All of the above are non-panicking** `Result` paths through the existing `run_forever`
  backoff. A keypair the cli cannot generate/persist → the heartbeat declines to start (fail
  closed) and the machine runs unlicensed-honest, never a crash.

## Rationale

- **The leaf-crate invariant is preserved exactly.** Generation (RNG) + persistence (I/O) — the
  only things the crate forbids — stay at the cli boundary. Ed25519 **signing is deterministic**
  (RFC 8032), so holding a loaded key and signing the COSE `Sig_structure` introduces no RNG and
  no I/O into the leaf crate. The byte-exact COSE/pre-image logic — the part that must be
  spec-exact and unit-tested — lives where it is testable in isolation, mirroring the existing
  `canonical_key_preimage` + key-trust verifier.
- **`coset` is the lowest-risk COSE choice**: its entire runtime closure is already in the graph
  (`ciborium`/`ciborium-io`), it is Apache-2.0 (deny-clean, no allowlist change), and its
  `create_signature(aad, signer)` API builds exactly the standard COSE_Sign1 the server
  verifies, with the Ed25519 signing delegated to a closure (so the seam stays clean and the
  RNG-free signing key stays at the boundary we choose).
- **The DPoP-nonce lifecycle** keeps the steady-state hot path free of an extra `/challenge`
  round-trip (the server hands the next nonce in each response), and `/challenge` is consulted
  only on cold start / nonce loss — matching the RFC 9449 pattern the spec cites.
- **Fail-closed everywhere** is the product promise: a licensing failure (including a PoP
  failure) must never take a broadcaster's program off air. PoP failures join the identical
  keep-last-good/back-off path #177 already proves under the CONSPECT-2 chaos gate.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Rejected because |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Hand-roll the COSE_Sign1 (no `coset`) | The COSE `Sig_structure` + protected-header CBOR is exactly the kind of byte-exact wire the spec under-specifies; a vetted, in-graph (`ciborium`-only), deny-clean library removes a whole class of encoding bugs at zero dependency cost. We already hand-roll the *pre-image* (a fixed map) where the contract is fully pinned; the COSE envelope is not. |
| Generate + persist the keypair **in the leaf crate** | Violates the crate's load-bearing invariant (no I/O, no RNG/entropy in non-test code). Generation needs entropy and persistence needs filesystem I/O — both belong at the cli boundary, alongside the existing `FileNonceStore` and `ConspectHttpServer`. |
| Build the whole COSE proof **in the cli** | The COSE/pre-image bytes are the part most likely to be wrong and most needing isolated unit tests (self-verify a produced proof). Keeping them pure in the leaf crate (behind a `DeviceSigner` seam) makes them testable byte-exactly without a network or a real key, exactly like the key-trust verifier. |
| Reuse the durable idempotency `FileNonceStore` for the PoP nonce | They are different objects with different lifecycles — the idempotency key is a client-minted retry-stable mutation key; the PoP nonce is the server's single-use challenge (DPoP-nonce). Conflating them would break both (a replayed idempotency key must reuse one value; a PoP nonce must rotate every cycle). Kept strictly separate. |
| Emit a **tagged** COSE_Sign1 (tag 18) | The spec example and prose describe a bare COSE_Sign1 verified by recomputation; the untagged 4-element array is the canonical interchange form. Flagged as a rule-26 item to confirm against the live server (tagged vs untagged is a one-line `to_tagged_vec()` swap if the server requires the tag). |
| Wait for a golden vector / live server before implementing | The server is **enforcing now** and leases cannot renew — this is broken in production. The spec descriptions are byte-exact enough to implement spec-correctly and unit-test (self-verifiable COSE_Sign1 over the exact pre-image); live-server validation is the explicit rule-26 follow-up the operator runs. |

## Consequences

- **Renewal works again** once the live server accepts the PoP proof (the broken-in-production
  state is resolved). The device gains a **stable cryptographic identity** persisted across
  restarts; the lease binds its `cnf_jkt` (holder-of-key).
- **The default build is unchanged**: `coset` is gated behind `heartbeat` (off by default), so
  `cargo check --workspace` + `cargo deny check` stay a pure, network-free, LGPL-clean shell.
- **A new secret on disk** (`<lease-dir>/device-key.ed25519`, `0600`) — documented in the
  licensing runbook; it must be backed up/migrated with the lease state to preserve device
  continuity (losing it forces a re-bind, which consumes the 3-free-per-year rebind budget).
- **Invariants #1/#10 are honoured**: every PoP failure is a fail-closed, non-panicking,
  keep-last-good path; the heartbeat task holds no engine handle and cannot stall output.
- **Rule-26 follow-up is REQUIRED and flagged in the PR**: this implementation is
  **spec-correct + unit-tested** (it produces a structurally-valid COSE_Sign1 over the exact
  pre-image that an independent verifier — the test itself, with the public key — accepts). It
  is **NOT live-server-validated** here (no live Conspect account/server is available in this
  environment). The operator runs PoP against the live Conspect server; the load-bearing
  unknowns to confirm are: the pre-image byte-layout/CBOR shape, the iat unit (seconds vs ms),
  attached-vs-detached payload, and tagged-vs-untagged COSE_Sign1.
- **Forward-compat**: activate/rebind/deactivate also require PoP; the same
  `canonical_pop_preimage` + `pop_header_value` + `DeviceSigner` seam serve them when those
  slices land (only `htm`/`htu`/body differ).
