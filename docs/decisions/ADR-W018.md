# ADR-W018: Live source apply — add / edit / remove on the running engine

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Area:** Web/API stack ↔ engine · sources management · live-apply (invariant #11)
- **Date:** 2026-06-10
- **Source:** [management-capability-matrix](../research/management-capability-matrix.md),
  [resilience-and-av](../research/resilience-and-av.md), [streaming-gotchas §1–§3](../research/streaming-gotchas.md);
  builds on ADR-W015 (typed CRUD + `X-Multiview-Apply`), ADR-W008 (command bus), ADR-T002
  (tile stores + state machine), ADR-0027 (synthetic sources), ADR-0018/ADR-0035 (GPU placement)

## Context

`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/v1/sources/{id}` validate (ADR-W015) and store — but the running engine
never sees the change: every response says `X-Multiview-Apply: restart`. The real pipeline builds
per-source ingest **at startup only** (`Pipeline::build` → `IngestSupervisor::start`, one decode
thread per `IngestPlan`; synthetic sources ride the same supervisor via
`SourceLocation::Synthetic` → `synth::generator_loop`). The engine command drain
(`CommandDrain::apply`, run on the output-clock loop at each frame boundary) already applies
swaps/routes/layouts/salvos live, but has no notion of a source coming or going.

Invariant #11 demands management changes classify as Class-1 (hot) or Class-2 and apply
accordingly; the operator directive demands source mutations apply **instantly** where the engine
can do so, with hardware allocation re-assessed on every change.

Hard constraints:

- **Inv #1:** nothing on the output-clock thread may block, allocate per-tick, or wait on a spawn.
  Thread spawn, libav open, network I/O are all *heavy* — they must happen off the render thread.
- **Inv #10:** control may never back-pressure the engine: bounded channels, reject/drop over grow.
- **One uniform ingest:** a runtime-added source must run the *same* supervised
  ingest/generator path the startup path builds — never a second quality of ingest.
- **GPU placement principle (ADR-0018/0035):** load informs placement of NEW work only; affinity
  is the hard constraint — a runtime add never fragments or migrates the running pipeline island.

## Decision

### 1. Two new engine commands on the existing bounded bus

`Command::UpsertSource { op, source: multiview_config::Source }` and
`Command::RemoveSource { op, id }` ride the same bounded, non-blocking command bus (ADR-W008).
The control plane submits them **after** the resource-store write succeeds; the engine drains them
at the frame boundary. A full bus sheds the submit (`SubmitError::Full`) — the store write stands,
and the response then *honestly* declares `restart` (the stored doc still applies on restart).

### 2. Per-response apply classification (inv #11)

The mutation response's `X-Multiview-Apply` header is computed per request:

| Mutation | Condition | Header |
|---|---|---|
| POST/PUT | new kind is **synthetic** (`bars`/`solid`/`clock`) and the `UpsertSource` was enqueued | `live` |
| PUT | previous stored kind synthetic, new kind not → `RemoveSource` enqueued (the running generator stops; the new doc applies on restart) | `restart` |
| POST/PUT | network kind (`rtsp`/`hls`/`ts`/`srt`/`rtmp`/`file`/`ndi`/`youtube`) | `restart` (level 2, designed below, not in this slice) |
| DELETE | `RemoveSource` enqueued (any kind — teardown is a stop-flag raise + store unregister) | `live` |
| any | bus full/closed, or no engine drains (no `[control]` run) | `restart` |

`SourceKind::is_synthetic()` (new, on `multiview-config`) is the single classification point —
the same predicate `SyntheticKind::from_source_kind` implements in the CLI.

### 3. Frame-boundary registration; heavy work on a hub worker (inv #1/#10)

The split is **register-on-the-drain, produce-on-the-hub**:

- **`CommandDrain` (output-clock loop, frame boundary)** does only cheap binding mutations:
  - `UpsertSource`: create **or reuse** the per-source `TileStore` (reuse on edit — see §5),
    `CompositorDrive::insert_store`, register the route key
    (`RouteResolution::set_video_store_key`), mirror the source into the working config (so
    `ApplyLayout`/swap validation and config export see it), then `try_send` a spawn request to
    the **LiveSourceHub** (bounded; a full hub queue drops + warns — the tile rides the slate,
    the clock never waits).
  - `RemoveSource`: `CompositorDrive::remove_store` (new engine API) — cells bound to the id
    composite their **on_loss failover slate** from the next tick (`sample_cell` already treats a
    missing store as `NoSignal`); mirror the removal out of the working config; `try_send` a
    teardown request to the hub.
  - Registering a store before its producer has published is the normal resilience model
    (ADR-T002): the tile rides `NO_SIGNAL`/slate until the first frame arrives, then goes `LIVE`.
- **`LiveSourceHub`** (new `multiview-cli::live_sources`): one worker thread owning a bounded
  request channel. It performs every heavy/blocking step: spawn the producer thread, tear down
  (raise the per-source stop flag, join with a bounded grace, detach a wedged thread — the same
  policy `IngestSupervisor::join_all` uses), and maintain the **shared preview store map**
  (`Arc<ArcSwap<HashMap<id, Arc<TileStore>>>>`, RCU per mutation) the `CliPreviewProvider` reads —
  so live-added sources appear as preview inputs without any lock on the render thread.

### 4. One uniform producer path + per-source stop flags

A hub-spawned synthetic producer runs the **same** `synth::generator_loop` the startup path runs
(same cadence pacing, same lock-free `TileStore` publish, same chunked stop-poll). When level 2
lands, a hub-spawned network producer runs the **same** `ingest_loop` (same supervised reconnect
with jittered backoff, jitter handling, PTS normalization, rw-timeout) — never a parallel ingest.

Teardown needs per-source granularity, so the startup supervisors move from one shared stop flag
to **one stop flag per producer thread**, registered in a shared **stop registry**
(`Arc<Mutex<HashMap<id, Arc<AtomicBool>>>>`, touched only off the hot path: at spawn, by the hub
worker, and at run teardown — never by the drain or the clock):

- `run.rs GeneratorSupervisor` and `pipeline.rs IngestSupervisor` register each spawned producer's
  flag; their `shutdown` raises all of their flags and joins as before.
- A live **remove**/**edit** raises the target id's flag via the registry on the hub worker — this
  tears down a *startup* producer (generator or, on the ffmpeg path, a network ingest thread)
  exactly like a hub-spawned one. A thread wedged in a blocking libav call is bounded by the
  existing `rw_timeout` + join-grace/detach policy.

### 5. Edit = upsert under the same id, reusing the store

`UpsertSource` for an existing id **keeps the registered `TileStore`** and swaps the producer
behind it (hub: teardown old → spawn new into the same store). The bound tile holds last-good and
rides the `LIVE → STALE → (RECONNECTING)` ladder while the producer swaps — it never falters and
never flashes the slate unless the new producer genuinely fails to produce (then the honest
`NO_SIGNAL` path applies). A kind change synthetic→network (until level 2) is a remove (the old
picture stopping is more honest than a stale generator pretending to be the new URL).

### 6. Removal semantics

Removal is a deliberate operator act, not a signal loss: the cell transitions to its `on_loss`
failover slate at the **next frame boundary** (the terminal state of the loss ladder) rather than
sitting in last-good/STALE limbo pretending the source still exists. Producer teardown, preview
unregistration, and memory release happen asynchronously and bounded on the hub. A cell whose
*config* still binds the removed id keeps compositing the slate; a subsequent `ApplyLayout`
re-solve will refuse (config validation requires declared bindings) with a warning until the
operator re-routes that cell — held, never a panic, never a falter.

### 7. Hardware re-assessment on every change

- **Synthetic add/edit/remove (this slice):** zero decode/GPU demand — there is nothing for the
  placement engine to place (CPU raster into a shared frame, one bake/s for a clock). Consulting
  the planner would be a fabricated no-op; we state that instead of pretending.
- **Network add (level 2 — designed here, ships with level 2):** the hub consults the **same**
  scorer the startup admission uses (`multiview_hal::select_device`, the exact
  `select_admission_pick` path in `pipeline.rs`), with two changes honouring the placement
  principle: candidates/pins are **pinned to the running island's device**
  (`Pins::pin_pipeline(island_device)`) — a runtime add may never fragment or migrate the island —
  and the demand is the island's current tile set **plus** the new decode (`TileLoad::new(Decode,
  …)`), re-polling NVML at decision time. An admit stamps the island's `cuda_ordinal` on the new
  `IngestPlan` (NVDEC co-located, ADR-0035 Tier-1/Tier-2 affinity + perf-class budget); a reject
  (budget/headroom) degrades **that source only** to software decode (`cuda_ordinal: None`) with a
  loud warning — the island is never overcommitted and the output never falters.
- **Removal returns its budget implicitly:** the startup path books nothing — placement decisions
  read *measured* NVML load per decision, so a removed source's NVDEC/VRAM consumption disappears
  from the next decision's inputs when its decoder closes. There is **no allocation ledger** to
  credit; per ADR-0035 the per-GPU `CostBudget`/perf-class table gates *demand*, not bookings.
  Gap (noted, not built here): a booking ledger would let admission reason about in-flight
  spawns that have not yet hit NVML counters.

### 8. Proof obligations (gates)

- **Soak/chaos (inv #1/#10):** extend the flooded-command-bus soak: continuous
  `UpsertSource`/`RouteVideo`/`RemoveSource` churn against a bounded run must yield exactly N
  frames for N ticks, never faltered. A realtime run must show a live-added source's tile reach
  `LIVE` (observed via `tile.state` events) and a removed source's cells return to slate.
- **Engine unit gates:** `remove_store` → bound cell composites slate next tick; `rebind_cell` to
  a removed source is an honest held error.
- **Route gates:** header truth-table above, pinned by integration tests over the real router.

## Scope shipped vs designed

Shipped in this slice (vertical, end-to-end, soak-gated): **level 1** (live add, synthetic kinds),
**level 3** (live remove, any kind whose producer is registry-known; composition-plane removal for
all kinds), **level 4** (live edit synthetic→synthetic via store-reuse upsert). The UI copy and
OpenAPI descriptions state exactly this per-kind split.

Designed but **not** shipped here (header stays `restart` — truthful): **level 2** network-kind
live add (rtsp/hls/ts/srt/rtmp/file via hub-spawned `ingest_loop` + the pinned placement consult
above), `ndi`/`youtube` kinds, caption-reader teardown on remove (a removed source's HLS-WebVTT
reader runs harmlessly into an orphan store until run end), and the placement booking ledger.

## Alternatives considered

- **Spawn producers on the drain (render thread)** — rejected: thread spawn + libav open are
  unbounded-latency; violates inv #1.
- **Engine-side spawner driven by a second channel from the route handler (bypassing the drain)** —
  rejected: registration must happen at a frame boundary with `&mut CompositorDrive` (the drain is
  the only seam with that access), and a single ordered command stream keeps upsert→route→remove
  sequences coherent (FIFO on one bus).
- **Tear down by removing the store but leaving the producer running** — rejected: leaks a thread
  + render work per removed source; per-source stop flags are cheap and uniform.
- **Ride the STALE→NO_SIGNAL ladder on remove (keep the store until it ages out)** — rejected:
  startup stores use `NoSignalPolicy::HoldForever`, so a removed source would freeze its last
  frame forever — dishonest. Deliberate removal cuts to the on_loss slate at the next boundary.
- **A separate live-apply REST surface (`/sources/{id}/apply`)** — rejected: inv #11 wants every
  mutation to declare how it applies; a second endpoint invites stored-vs-live drift.
- **Re-running the whole island admission pick on every add** — rejected: could name a *different*
  GPU and imply migration; the placement principle pins runtime adds to the island device.

## Consequences

- The command bus now carries config payloads (`Source` is `Clone + PartialEq`); the drain mirrors
  them into its working config, so export/`ApplyLayout` stay coherent with live state.
- `CompositorDrive` gains `remove_store`/`store` accessors; removal makes a bound cell slate —
  pinned by engine tests.
- The preview provider's input set becomes dynamic (shared `ArcSwap` map) — `input_ids()` reflects
  live adds/removes.
- Startup supervisors carry one stop flag per producer (same join semantics; `shutdown` raises
  all), enabling targeted teardown forever after.
- When level 2 lands, the header flips to `live` for network kinds with **no path change** —
  exactly the per-class flip ADR-W015 anticipated.
