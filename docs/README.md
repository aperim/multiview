# Multiview Documentation

**Multiview** is an efficient, hardware-accelerated, Rust live video multiview generator: ingest many
live sources, composite a templated multiview on the GPU, and serve it robustly. It is built to run
great on **commodity hardware** and to produce **bulletproof, continuous output** — at every tick
of one fixed internal clock, the engine emits exactly one valid frame, **forever**, independent of
any input.

This is the documentation portal — the single navigational entrypoint. Start with the
[Conventions](architecture/conventions.md) (the source of truth) and the
[Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md), then dive into the area you need. If you are an
agent working in the code, read [Working in this monorepo](development/working-in-this-monorepo.md).
For the implementation plan and per-feature status, see [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and
[FEATURES.md](../FEATURES.md).

> **Reading map.** The [research briefs](research/) are the deep, verification-hardened design
> records; the [ADRs](decisions/) capture the load-bearing decisions distilled from them; the
> [conventions](architecture/conventions.md) pin canonical names/APIs/invariants and **win** wherever
> a brief differs. Topic docs below summarize and cross-link rather than duplicate.

## Core invariants (read these first)

Every doc and implementation respects these; full details in
[conventions §5](architecture/conventions.md#5-canonical-technical-invariants) and the briefs.

1. **Output-clock invariant** — one fixed-cadence clock emits exactly one valid frame (+ audio) per
   tick, forever; output PTS = `f(tick)`. Inputs are *sampled*, never *pacing*.
2. **Per-tile last-good-frame + state machine** — lock-free single-slot stores; the compositor never
   blocks; tiles ride LIVE -> STALE -> RECONNECTING -> NO_SIGNAL.
3. **NV12-throughout** — frames stay NV12; YUV -> RGB happens in-shader at tile size.
4. **Encode-once, mux-many** — composite once, encode per rendition, fan the same packets to all
   transports.
5. **Fixed color pipeline order** — detect 4 axes -> range-expand -> matrix -> linearize -> blend in
   linear -> OETF -> compress -> tag output -> verify.
6. **Isolation** — control plane, preview, and realtime layers are *physically incapable* of
   back-pressuring the engine; a CI chaos gate enforces it.

## Conventions for these docs

- **Crate names** are always `multiview-<area>` (kebab); types `UpperCamel`; features `kebab-case`.
- **Link** to the deep brief in [`research/`](research/) or an [`ADR`](decisions/) rather than
  duplicating it.
- Where any doc disagrees with [`architecture/conventions.md`](architecture/conventions.md), the
  conventions win (and the Rust code is the ultimate source of truth).
