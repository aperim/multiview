name: orchestrate
description: Run the single-orchestrator "Conductor" loop — plan a wave of dependency-ready work, fan it out across disjoint file territories via workflows and agent teams, integrate as the sole integrator, gate each diff through cross-vendor (Codex) review, merge, clean up, record, and reschedule. Use when driving the Multiview backlog forward as one orchestrator instead of many independent terminals (ADR-G007).

# The Conductor loop

One long-lived orchestrator session owns the work loop (ADR-G007). It is the **sole
board writer, sole integrator, sole `memory` client, and owns every PR to merge +
cleanup**. It fans out broadly but never lets two concurrent lanes touch the same file
territory. The *why* is [ADR-G007](../../../docs/decisions/ADR-G007.md); this skill is
the *how*. Lane mechanics are the [`worktree-lane`](../worktree-lane/SKILL.md) skill;
recall/record is the [`memory`](../memory/SKILL.md) skill.

> **Golden rule:** collisions can't surface at merge if colliding lanes are never
> *assigned* at once. Disjoint territory per concurrent lane; **hot shared files are
> serial** (one owner). Everything else follows.

## One iteration (a "wave")

### ① PLAN
- Recall: `qdrant-find` the topic; read `docs/development/work-schedule.md` (Part 2
  checklist + Part 3 items; 400 KB — **search with `rg`, never read whole**) and
  `gh pr list --state open`.
- Pick the next set of **dependency-ready** items (`deps:` satisfied, status `[ ]`/`[~]`),
  each mappable to **one disjoint territory** (see table below). Cap the wave at the
  concurrency you can integrate + review well (start ~3–5 lanes).
- Any item touching a **serial hot file** (`pipeline.rs`, `engine/{runtime,clock,drive}.rs`,
  `control/{routes/mod,openapi,state}.rs`) goes to that file's single owner lane; other
  lanes in the wave file the body and hand wiring to the owner.

### ② ASSIGN
- Record each lane as `territory → item(s) → owner` on the board (you are the only
  writer). Note the **authoring vendor** per lane so REVIEW can pick a different one.

### ③ FAN OUT — two modes
- **Workflow mode** (`Workflow` tool; scripts in [`.claude/workflows/`](../../workflows/)):
  for sub-steps that are themselves decompose→verify→synthesize fan-outs. Reusable named
  workflows: `orient`, `wave-fanout`, `review-wave`, `cleanup-sweep`. Each agent that
  mutates files runs `isolation: 'worktree'`.
- **Team mode** (background `Agent` + shared `TaskList` + `SendMessage`): for lane-length
  stateful implementation. Each teammate owns exactly one territory's worktree, runs
  TDD (red test committed first, rule 18), and returns its commit SHA(s).
- **Every lane bases on current HEAD** (rule 8). If a pre-existing lane is on a stale
  base (common — every in-flight lane on 2026-06-16 was), **rebase onto current `main`
  before integrating** or cherry-picks conflict.

### ④ INTEGRATE (sole integrator)
- `git log origin/main..<lane-HEAD>` to find **all** of a lane's commits; cherry-pick as
  **individual single commits** (rule 13), not ranges.
- **Rebuild from a clean, isolated `target/` before trusting green** (rule 11) — a shared
  cache can link a sibling's stale artifacts and fake a pass. Never set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
  to `/tmp` (rule 10). Run the rule-15 local gate: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`,
  `cargo deny check` if deps changed (+ `web/` lint/typecheck/build if `web/` changed).

### ⑤ REVIEW — adversarial, cross-vendor, fresh context (rule 21)
- Dispatch the lane's diff to a **different vendor** than authored it, seeing **only**
  diff + spec/PLAN + the checklist — never the author's chat history. Default here:
  Claude-authored → **Codex** reviews. Invocation pattern:

  ```bash
  git diff origin/main...<lane-HEAD> > /tmp/review.diff
  codex exec --sandbox read-only \
    "Adversarial review for correctness/security/spec/guardrail defects ONLY (see \
     docs/development/agent-guardrails.md §C). Here is the diff and the item spec. \
     Report concrete defects with file:line; if none, name the single highest-residual \
     risk. Do not comment on style." < /tmp/review.diff
  ```
- Require **≥1 substantive risk statement** (unanimous bland approval is a yellow flag,
  rule 16). Fix every finding before merge (a "blocked" verdict is real, rule 16).
- **High-risk diffs** (auth, concurrency, data migration, money, and any engine/data-plane
  change touching invariant #1/#10) → **3-reviewer panel** + notify the operator.

### ⑥ MERGE (ADR-G005)
- Merge only on **green required deterministic checks** + a passing cross-vendor review.
  Never `--admin`/bypass branch protection; never weaken/skip a test to go green
  (rule 19 — STOP and ask a human instead).

### ⑦ CLEAN (rule 9)
- `git worktree remove` the lane (+ `git worktree prune`), delete its branch, then
  `git fetch origin && git pull --ff-only origin main` in the root so the **next wave
  bases on current HEAD**. Never force-remove a `locked` worktree of a *live* session;
  if a `locked` worktree's owning pid is dead, salvage its WIP to a `salvage/*` branch
  first (see Salvage below).

### ⑧ RECORD
- Flip the board checkbox + set the Part-3 Status; add the red→green commit SHAs + PR
  number inline. `qdrant-store` every non-obvious decision, operator correction, and
  hard-won gotcha (rule: store proactively). Write/refresh the resource runbook in the
  **same** change that touched infrastructure (rule 42).

### ⑨ RESCHEDULE
- `ScheduleWakeup` the next iteration (fully self-paced per operator directive
  2026-06-16). Keep the agenda durable on the board so a fresh wake can resume it.
  Operator can interrupt at any time and retains override (ADR-G005).

## Territory map (disjoint; refines work-schedule.md §1c)

Serial **one-owner-only** territories (never two concurrent lanes here):
- **LANE-CORE** — `multiview-cli/src/{pipeline,sink,run,control}.rs`,
  `multiview-engine/src/{runtime,drive,clock}.rs`, `multiview-events/src/event.rs`,
  `multiview-config/src/schema.rs`.
- **LANE-API** — `multiview-control/src/{routes/mod,openapi,openapi_schemas,asyncapi,state,lib}.rs`,
  `docs/api/openapi.json`, auth/session/RBAC.

One-owner territories (parallelizable across the wave):
LANE-WRTC (`multiview-webrtc/**`, `preview/src/whep*`, `control/routes/{whip,whep_serve}.rs`)
· LANE-IN (`multiview-input/**`, `multiview-rist-sys/**`) · LANE-PRV (`multiview-preview/**`
minus WHEP transport) · LANE-ENG (`multiview-engine/**` minus runtime/clock/drive;
`hal/src/load.rs`) · LANE-GPU (`multiview-compositor/**`, `multiview-framestore/**`,
`multiview-ffmpeg/**`, `hal/src/select.rs`) · LANE-AUDIO (`multiview-audio/**`,
`multiview-overlay/**`) · LANE-BCAST (`control/src/{nmos,is07}*`, `multiview-output/**`)
· LANE-WEB (`web/**`) · LANE-DEVICES (zowietek/display-kms/sync/cast/node-enroll,
`deploy/**`) · LANE-CONSPECT (`multiview-licence/**`, `multiview-mesh/**`) ·
LANE-GOV (`.claude/**`, `docs/{decisions,research,runbooks}`, `.github/workflows/**`).

When two items genuinely need the same territory in one wave, **serialize them under one
owner** — do not split the territory.

## Salvage (orphaned `locked` lane with a dead owning pid)

```bash
# work is preserved as a readable, recoverable branch before the worktree is removed
git -C <lane> add -A && git -C <lane> commit -m "wip(salvage): <what> — recovered by Conductor"
git branch salvage/<descriptive-name> $(git -C <lane> rev-parse HEAD)
git worktree unlock <lane> && git worktree remove --force <lane>
```
Then queue the salvage branch for rebase + completion in the owning territory's lane.

## Non-negotiables (never relax under self-pacing)

- Invariants **#1 (output-clock)** and **#10 (isolation)** are blocking for any
  engine/data-plane wave — chaos/soak + mutation bars before merge.
- The three pillars (typing, TDD-first with real tests, adversarial cross-vendor review)
  and all 42 rules bind every wave. Autonomy is pace, never a lower bar (rule 7).
- Confirm genuinely destructive/outward-facing actions with the operator (force-push
  `main`, delete infra, public release, external comms) — the loop does not do these
  silently.
