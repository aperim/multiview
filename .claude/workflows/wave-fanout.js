// wave-fanout — launch one wave of lane work across DISJOINT file territories, each in
// its own isolated worktree meeting its own class's gates, returning committed work + an
// opened PR for the orchestrator to review (review-wave) and merge. Each lane classifies
// itself with `scripts/classify.sh`; the class is a floor it may raise, never lower.
// Territories must be disjoint and hot shared files (pipeline.rs,
// engine/{runtime,clock,drive}.rs, control/{routes/mod,openapi,state}.rs) must be
// assigned to a single owner lane — the orchestrator guarantees this when it partitions
// the wave (.claude/skills/orchestrate/lib/partition.mjs) before calling. Usage:
//   Workflow({ name: 'wave-fanout', args: { lanes: [
//     { id: 'gpu-hwdefect', territory: 'LANE-GPU', item: 'HW-DEFECT-A', prompt: '...' , highRisk: false },
//     ... ] } })
