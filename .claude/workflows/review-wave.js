// review-wave — rule-21 adversarial cross-vendor review of one or more diffs/PRs.
// Each Claude-authored diff is reviewed by a DIFFERENT vendor (Codex) in a fresh
// context seeing only the diff + spec + checklist. High-risk items get a 3-reviewer
// panel (Codex + two fresh-context lenses). Returns structured verdicts; the
// orchestrator gates merge on them. Usage:
//   Workflow({ name: 'review-wave', args: { items: [
//     { id: 'pr-170', ref: '170', spec: 'webrtc ICE concrete local addr; invariant #10 isolation', highRisk: false },
//     { id: 'pr-172', ref: '172', spec: 'output-clock cadence-hold; invariant #1', highRisk: true } ] } })
// ref = a PR number (reviewed via `gh pr diff <n>`) or a git ref (`git diff origin/main...<ref>`).

Use the read-only/non-interactive exec form (e.g. \`codex exec --sandbox read-only "<prompt>"\`). The prompt must tell Codex to read /tmp/rv-${it.id}${idSuffix}.diff and review it.\n` +
    `3. Prompt Codex: "Adversarially review this diff. Spec: ${it.spec}. ${lensNote} ${CHECKLIST}". Capture Codex's full output (give it a generous timeout).\n` +
    `4. If Codex ran, set reviewer="codex"${idSuffix ? ' (lens: ' + lensNote + ')' : ''}, ranOk=true, and STRUCTURE CODEX'S findings into the verdict (do not invent defects Codex did not raise; do not drop ones it did). If Codex could NOT be run after a genuine attempt (report the error), fall back to performing the review yourself in this fresh context, set reviewer="claude-fallback", ranOk=false, set blocked=true (a fallback is not cross-vendor and must fail closed), and note the error in highestResidualRisk.\n` +
